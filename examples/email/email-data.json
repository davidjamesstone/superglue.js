We\ninvite you to serve as our opening keynote speaker at the kick off luncheon\non Wednesday, April 25 to help set the tone, goals and objectives for this\nevent.\n\nOur theme is \"2001: An Energy Odyssey.\" We are using the conference to\nshowcase the role of economics in developing markets for energy, and to\ndeal with issues that impede, or facilitate, market development as well as\nenterprise strategy and metamorphosis.  We can think of no one better to\nclearly define these major themes and priorities than you.\n\nI was a speaker and delegate at the World Forum on Energy Regulation in\nMontreal last May, and greatly enjoyed your luncheon keynote (and hope that\nthe regulators and policy makers attending the Forum took your key points t=\no\nheart).  The thoughts you offered -- on the importance of standards, the\nopportunities to build network platforms and Enron's own experience, are of\nvital importance to IAEE/USAEE members.  We would ask you to include\ncomments on the fundamental importance of economic principles in both\nguiding market development and the efforts of those of us who operate in\nmarkets on behalf of enterprises.\n\nThe IAEE remains the largest worldwide combination of industry, business an=\nd\nuniversity interests engaged in energy development and policy.  To bring yo=\nu\nup-to-date on the association, our Web site is www.iaee.org. I'm sure\nRosilea will have someone on her staff pull the relevant materials together\nfor you. I have also included the call for papers for the Houston conferenc=\ne\n(at the end of this mail) which lines out the major sessions and topics. In\naddition to our invitation to you, we are inviting Mark Moody-Stuart of\nRD/Shell for the April 26 keynote luncheon to address environmental issues\nand Rilwanu Lukman, Secretary General of OPEC (and a member of IAEE), in a\njoint session with the Board of Directors of the Offshore Technology\nConference on Friday, to cover worldwide outlooks for oil and gas.\n\nFinally, as you know, Enron Corp. for some time has been a corporate\nsponsor of our UH Energy Institute and the previous Natural Gas Project,\nwhich you helped to found.  Thus, we also are relying on Rob Bradley to hel=\np\nidentify and implement the major environmental themes for the plenary\nsession, \"Sustaining Development\" (yes, we indeed are trying to turn\nthinking around with our re-phrasing).\n\nI hope to hear from Rosilea soon on your interest and availability.

I'm working at it! \n\nRosalie said you'd be getting in this afternoon, and I? wanted to reach you \nby phone or e-mail before Governor Tony Knowles from Alaska calls you.? \nGovernor Knowles (classmate of George W.), along with Governor Taft of Ohio, \nhas enlisted us in a conference that seven governors are sponsoring on \nnatural gas in order to elucidate the market and issues -- and needs -- \nbefore it explodes as a political issue -- and perhaps helps head it off (in \ncontrast to what happened with gasoline).? Governor Knowles is the current \nchairman of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission, and it will be under the \nauspices of the IOCC.? They promise at least seven governors and a lot of \nother distinguished people.? It seems to us that this is a very timely event.\n\nThey would like to invite you to be the luncheon speaker.? (I will be kicking \noff the conference).?? It looks to be a very good and high visibility \nplatform.? And they would be very keen and excited -- and honored -- to have \nyou in that featured role in it works for your schedule.\n\nIt takes place in Columbus, Ohio, on September 20. \n\nTony is a very good guy, and of course natural gas as well as oil looms very \nlarge for him.? You'll enjoy talking with him.? He can certainly fill you in \nfurther on what they would like to accomplish.\n\nIf it works out for you to do this in terms of your schedule and interest, \nthat would be great. \n\nOn behalf of the governors, thank you for the consideration. \n\nBest, \n\nDan \n\n\n",

Baker & Botts put us in touch with the Rockets to discuss Hines\nbeing the Development Manager on the Arena and garage.  Although not fully\nagreed, there is strong interest on both sides.  Besides help on the\ndevelopment front, we think there may be value in our acting as a bit of a\nbuffer between the Sports Authority and the Rockets and coordinating any\nissues involving the new convention hotel(where we are also providing\ndevelopment management).  The Rockets(Mike Goldberg-Baker & Botts) have\ntalked to Ric Campo and supposedly he is enthusiastic but thinks this\nshould \"be the Authority's idea.\".  One issue is how much of our fee would\napply to the garage, which presumably the city would pick up, and how much\nwould apply to the Arena.  Since this is a fast moving issue, I wanted you\nto know about this. Obviously the discussions are all very confidential.\nIf you have any thoughts in advance of the next breakfast meeting, please\ngive me a call at 713-966-2606.\n\nAlso, on another topic, we have been doing a tiny bit of pie in the sky\nbrainstorming on the concept of creating some kind of Futures/Options\nmarket in the commercial space market.  I will approach Jeff Skilling\nunless you would recommend elsewhere within Enron.\n\n\n",

Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship - this is fine.\n2)  He will be pleased to serve as the keynote speaker for the banquet on \nOctober 13.\n\nThanks.\n\nRosalee\n\n\n\n\n\"Walker, Bruce J.\" <Walker@missouri.edu> on 08/28/2000 04:17:56 PM\nTo: \"'kenneth.lay@enron.com'\" <kenneth.lay@enron.com>\ncc: \"'rosalee.fleming@enron.com'\" <rosalee.fleming@enron.com> \nSubject: P. Walker professorship and keynote request\n\n\nThanks so much for your most generous gift to complete the funding for the\nprofessorship honoring Pinkney Walker.  I'm delighted that you plan to\nattend the Davenport Society banquet on October 13.\n\nThe purpose of this e-mail, which Rosalee suggested as the most efficient\nway of reaching you, is two-fold:\n\n     1. To seek your endorsement of naming the new professorship the Pinkney\nC. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship.  Rather than designating the\nprofessorship for Business and Economics, for Business Theory, or for some\nother area, I'd like to use it to recognize and reward a faculty member in\nthe College of Business who is especially known for teaching effectiveness.\nBoth Bob Pugh and Ralph Clark endorse this approach; I have a call into\nHarold Hook to seek his input.\n\nA few points of elaboration:\n     * \"Distinguished\" is a standard adjective in the titles of such\npositions.\n     * We will use a committee of faculty and administrators within the\ncollege to select the recipient of the professorship, subject to my\napproval.\n     * And, I don't know if we will have the recipient selected by October\n13.\n\nThis name for the professorship (1) coincides with Pinkney's great strength,\n(2) allows me to avoid any \"turf battles\" (either within the college or with\nEconomics) and (3) underscores the great importance of teaching in the\ncollege.  Please let me know whether you are agreeable to this name.\n\n     2. To ask you to serve as the keynote speaker for the Davenport Society\nbanquet on October 13.  We would be honored if you would present a brief\ntalk (perhaps 10 minutes in length) related to some aspect of the future of\nbusiness.  Your doing so would certainly add luster to an always festive\nevent.  By way of brief background, Jack and Mary Bush, MU alumni who now\nlive in Dallas and are co-chairs of the Davenport Society this year, have\nchosen the future of business as the theme for the banquet and program.\nYour talk would come after dinner and could be preceded or followed\n(probably followed) by the announcement of the Pinkney Walker Professorship.\nI understand from Rosalee that you will be giving a talk in Austin the\nmorning of October 13; perhaps an abridged version of it would be suitable\nfor the Davenport Society banquet.  Of course, you have great latitude in\nchoosing the topic you would like to address.  Please let me know if you\nwill serve as the keynote speaker.\n\nIf you can give me quick responses to these 2 requests, we will complete the\nplans for the evening, which will include the annoucement of the Pinkney\nWalker Professorship and, I hope, a keynote address by you.  Naturally, if\nyou have questions, either you or Rosalee can call me.  My office # is\n573/882-6688, and my home # is 573/875-2972.\n\nLet me close by mentioning that there was some question as to whether or not\nPinkney would attend the banquet on October 13.  Apparently he had/has been\nexperiencing some health problems.  However, the latest I've heard is that\nhe intends to attend, due in large part to your commitment to be there.\nTime permitting, you might want to give him a quick call to tell him you'll\nsee him here in Columbia on October 13.  (By the way, if Pinkney and his\nwife arrive on October 12, I will invite them to attend an informal dinner I\nwill host that evening for members of the college's advisory board.  Of\ncourse, you are invited to attend the dinner on October 12 as well, but it's\nmy understanding that you will fly to Columbia on October 13.)\n\nKen, thanks very much.  I hope and trust that you had an ample dose of \"R&R\"\nduring your vacation.  I look forward to hearing from you.\n\n",

The economic and \nbusiness climate is positive and full of new opportunities as Mexico finally \ncompletes a long transition from one-party dominance to pluralist democracy, \nadding political maturity to a more competitive market economy.\n\nIn light of the above, the World Economic Forum will hold a Mexico Meeting \n2000 on 4-5 December in Mexico City. Held in collaboration with the Mexican \nInvestment Board, this gathering will take place three days after the \ninauguration of the new Mexican administration. We have already received \nconfirmation that President-elect Vicente Fox and Mexican Central Bank \nGovernor Guillermo Ortiz will participate. We are also expecting the presence \nof the future key cabinet members and state governors.\n\nAs usual, the World Economic Forum pulls together the right group of leaders \nto discuss issues, build a network of contacts and identify where future \nbusiness opportunities and risks lie. The Meeting will focus on four main \ntopics: the country's political and social agenda, Mexico's commercial \nrelationships with the rest of the world, the new economy and the key issues \nfor the country's main industries.\n\nPlease consult our website, http://www.weforum.org/mexico, where information \nwill be updated as soon as it becomes available.\n\nFor further information, please do not hesitate to contact Gisela Galicia at \n(41 22) 869 1450 or mailto:mexicomeeting@weforum.org\n(  ) Please send me more information on the conditions for participation.\n\n(  ) Please send information to:\n\n- Name:\n- Position:\n- Company:\n- Tel.:\n- Fax:\n- E-mail:\n\n( XX ) I am unable to participate in the Mexico Meeting 2000.\n\nPlease tick the appropriate response and return this form to Gisela Galicia \nby fax: (41 22) 786 2744 or via e-mail: mailto:mexicomeeting@weforum.org\nWe look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\n\n\n",

  "text": "Cynthia, Ken said to tell you that he told David Sokol we would probably \noppose it.\n\nRosie\n\n\n\nCynthia Sandherr\n09/08/2000 04:49 PM\n\n\nTo: Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard \nShapiro/HOU/EES@EES, James D Steffes/HOU/EES@EES, Joe \nHillings/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Tom Briggs/NA/Enron@Enron, Joe \nHartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Sarah Novosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON, \ndwatkiss@bracepatt.com, awenner@velaw.com\ncc:  \nSubject: New PUHCA Exemption Legislative Language\n\nYesterday, Ken Lay spoke with MidAmerican CEO David Sokol regarding the \nattached new legislative amendment to provide a limited PUHCA exemption for \ncompanies with a high level of financial stability as determined by \nindependent market analysts (i.e. \"A\" rating for Holding Companies or \ninvestment grade rating for utility companies).  This is not a permanent \nexemption as PUHCA would again apply should the company loose its high rating.\n\nMidAmerican's lobbyist reported this conversation to me along with Ken Lay's \nreported commitment that we would review it as soon as we could.  Reportedly, \nKen Lay was non-committal but not negatively disposed.\n\nThe utility strategy is to have Senator Bob Kerrey (D-NE) offer this as an \namendment to a \"must pass\" piece of legislation during the waning days of \nthis Congressional session.  This will be separate from the utilities' \nstrategy to enact Private Use legislation (H.R. 4971, S. 2967 which includes \ntax language to exclude water and sewage connection fees from gross income as \ncontributions to capital and language to increase the amount permitted to \npaid into nuclear decommissioning reserve funds primarily  for Commonwealth \nEdison) and to enact stand-alone Reliability legislation (S. 2071 and H.R. \n2944).\n\nSenator Kerrey has already spoken to Senator Gramm (R-TX) about this PUHCA \namendment and Gramm was reportedly  non-committal but not negatively disposed \nto the idea.  I will follow-up with Gramm's staff next week after they've \nreviewed it and convey their views to you.  According to MidAmerican,  the \nconcept to insure stockholder protection along with consumer protection was \nSenator Kerrey's idea.  \n\nIt is possible that Congressman Dingell (D-MI) and Congressman Markey (D-MA) \nwould still actively oppose this limited exemption, especially given the fact \nthat Congressman Dingell (who would Chair the Commerce Committee should the \nDemocrats regain control of the House) has recently said that whether or not \nhe is Commerce Committee Chairman next Congress, that comprehensive \nelectricity restructuring legislation including PUHCA repeal is \"at least \nthree years away from happening.\"\n\nSteve and Rick, can we get a temperature gauge next week as to our position \non this amendment?  As a reminder, Enron's position here-to-date has been to \noppose stand-alone PUHCA repeal as this is the one provision utilities like \nSouthern Company really want.  To date, this strategy has worked with the \nMidAmerican Utility Group willing to support our transmission open access \nprovisions in turn for our PUHCA exemption support. \n\n\n\n\n",

The contributions will be paid to the referendum campaign by the\npartnership, on behalf of each partner, upon receipt of instructions from\neach such partner that its share of the amount prepaid should be contributed\nto the campaign instead of being distributed.  I have discussed this\nprocedure with Sue Walden.\n\nWith respect to your arrangement with Shell, we were not sure what you and\nShell had agreed to.  The monies being contributed to the referendum\ncampaign are being contributed to a special purpose political action\ncommittee (as required by law).  This special purpose PAC is subject to the\ngeneral Texas laws that govern campaign fundraising.  As you know, one of\nthese laws provides that \"a person may not knowingly make or authorize a\npolitical contribution in the name of or on behalf of another unless the\nperson discloses in writing to the recipient the name and address of the\nperson actually making the contribution . . . .\"   Pending a better\nunderstanding of the Shell arrangement, we will hold Shell's $100,000 in the\npartnership's account.\n\nPlease contact John Watson at 713-758-2556 or me at 713-758-2350 if you have\nany questions regarding the foregoing.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael S.

I think it's\nalways easiest for someone like him if he knows that a speech given recently\ncan easily serve as the basis for a new request.  I wanted to remind you of\nmy previous suggestion that his keynote presentation in Montreal last May to\nthe World Forum on Energy Regulation would accomplish most of that, and we\nwould work with Rob and others to minimize any effort required to add new\ncontent.  Hopefully, this will help with the decision this week.

We understand completely that the April 25 slot following\nhis return from vacation is not the most ideal arrangement.  I think it's\nalways easiest for someone like him if he knows that a speech given recently\ncan easily serve as the basis for a new request.  I wanted to remind you of\nmy previous suggestion that his keynote presentation in Montreal last May to\nthe World Forum on Energy Regulation would accomplish most of that, and we\nwould work with Rob and others to minimize any effort required to add new\ncontent.  Hopefully, this will help with the decision this week.  As I\nmentioned the other day, Ken is really the most authoritative figure when it\ncomes to the idea that economic concepts can be used to build energy markets\nand business enterprises that lead to better societies!  Talk soon, and\ndon't hesitate to ever ask for a \"quid pro quo\" from us.\n\nMichelle Michot Foss, Ph.D.\nDirector, Energy Institute\nBauer College of Business\nUniversity of Houston\nHouston, TX  77204-6283\nTel. 713-743-4634\nFax  713-743-4881\nwww.uh.edu/energyinstitute\n\n\n",

Every vote counts, even those of you in Texas.\nPlease, remember to vote and go early, polls open at\n7am across the country and close at 7pm but don't put\nit off until 7pm as there could be lines and the\nsupervisors are not required to keep the polls open\nafter 7pm for those in line.\nRemind your friends and family to vote and if someone\nneeds transportation to the polls, give them a ride or\ncall your local Victory 2000 office (Republicans) or\nyour local Democratic campaign office, they will have\npeople available to transport people to the polls.\nKeep an eye out while you are at the polls for\nelectoral fraud and report any suspicious activity\nincluding inappropriate campaigning to the poll\nwatchers at the polls. The Democrats and the\nRepublicans will have representatives at most of the\npolls, let them know if there is suspicious activity.\nFinally, if you have time, call your local offices and\noffer your time to make phone calls to encourage\npeople to get out and vote, pass out leaflets, or to\nbe available to help prevent of voter fraud.\n\nFinally, enjoy the evening and watch the results come\nin. There are election watch parties everywhere!!!\n\nJust one more day (and no more mass political e-mail's\nfrom me and everyone else)!\nTake care and VOTE!\nLiz\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nThousands of Stores.

I want to thank those who provided me\nfeedback either in person, over the telephone or through e-mail.\n\n\"The performance of any individual in my administration ultimately rests\nwith me.  I want to apologize for the concern, pain and fear caused by the\ntaped comments made years ago by Chief Kroeker.  His taped comments in no\nway reflect my own personal beliefs.\n\n\"My community and staff discussions, along with reading all the e-mails and\ntranscripts of all my telephone messages, helped distill my thinking on this\nissue to one key question: Can Chief Kroeker separate his personal religious\nviews from his professional conduct?\n\n\"I have determined that he manages his duties without bias and will continue\nto do so. His performance has met my expectations.  He is leading the bureau\nin a fair, respectful and inclusive manner.  He is moving our law\nenforcement efforts to a higher level of community policing.  Therefore, I\nhave asked Mark Kroeker to stay on as Chief of Police.  He has my strong\nsupport to continue.\n\n\"The law provides that all city employees have a right to their personal\nreligious views.  I have a responsibility to review their employment status\nif their actions, as a result of their personal views, impair their ability\nto perform their professional responsibilities.\n\n\"Many of the arguments raised asking me to dismiss Mark Kroeker because he\nis \"out of step with Portland\" could be used in other Oregon communities to\nfire more liberal public officials who are \"out of step\" with their\ncommunity's conservative majority.  My 30-year fight for tolerance goes both\nways.\n\n\"Chief Kroeker will have to rebuild trust with many of our citizens.   He\nassures me he is prepared to do so.  He told me he would rather help undo\nthe damage, help me promote tolerance and acceptance of all people, than\njust walk away.\n\n\"He commits to a strong and sustained positive dialogue with Portlanders who\nare gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered, including those on his staff.\nHe has already begun outreach efforts and will continue to do so.\n\n\"He said he will redouble his efforts to promote respect and acceptance of\nall Portlanders and be steadfast and fair in his enforcement of the law.\n\n\"He agrees to work with the Cascade Aids Project to serve as a spokesperson\nto educate citizens about the fact that AIDS is not a \"gay disease.\"\n\n\"He will continue to seek advice from the City Council, the Bureau's Sexual\nMinority Roundtable and others to guide additional efforts.\n\n\"He agrees to take all this on with all his heart.\n\n\"In the process I hope he and we all learn from this experience.  I will\nwork to turn this negative situation into a positive one: to expand our\nsense of tolerance; to promote the notion that regardless of a person's\npersonal or religious beliefs, one can be an effective public servant; and\nto deepen the acceptance of all Portlanders.\n\n\"As Mayor, I will do my part and more.  I hope you will join me.\"\n\n\n\n",

He told Bill that this is the third time he has reported \nthis problem.  I spoke personally with Bill about this.  We checked and there \nis no record of this problem reported recently (we checked back to May 2000) \non all three Falcon 900's.\n\nLyndel checked the system and there does seem to be a problem with it \ndisconnecting if you pick it up before the third ring.  After the third ring \nit works fine.  That is all I know at this time.  Garrett Av is coming over \ntoday to check the system.\n\nI know you don't like emails but I didn't want this it slip by.  I've \ndiscussed this with Ron and John as well.\n\nKeith\n\n\n",

I also recently have become \ninvolved with something called the Park Leadership Fellowship Board which \nprovides scholarships and forums to discuss business leadership issues.  They \nare holding a pretty prominent event called Leadership week which will \ninclude the business heads of Corning and American Express discussing their \ncompany's strategies for defining leadership in business today.  I hate to \nask you guys to do things like this but it is a pretty big event and would \nreally highlight Enron's recognition of Cornell as being a \"Core School\" in \nthe MBA recruiting process.  The event as outlined below is scheduled for \nMarch 28th.  I appreciate your consideration.\n\nKevin\n\n----- Forwarded by Kevin Hannon/Enron Communications on 11/29/00 08:38 AM \n-----\n\n\tras22@cornell.edu\n\t11/29/00 06:19 AM\n\t\t \n\t\t To: Kevin Hannon/Enron Communications@Enron Communications\n\t\t cc: \n\t\t Subject: \n\nKevin-\n\n\nJust a quick follow-up on my November 2 email regarding Enron's\nparticipation in the Johnson School's March Leadership Week and the\npossibility of doing a case study on Enron.  Wondered if you have had a\nchance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken?  I know you have lots on\nyou plate.  Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go. \nBelow is the earlier email I sent to you.  Thanks for the help.  Hope all\nis well with you.\n\n\n            Nov.2 email text\n\n\nWe at Cornell's Johnson School would like to establish a stronger link\nwith Enron, a company which we believe to be a leading example of the\nagile organization which will dominate in the dynamic, unpredictable\nmarkets of the next decade.  One connecting point which we would like\nEnron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic\nOrganizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell and\nbeyond.\n\n\nThe specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two. \nFirst, we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a key\nspeaker at the Johnson School's Leadership Week in March, 2001.  As\ndescribed in the attached materials, Leadership Week is made up of three\nconferences focused on academic faculty, leading-edge corporations and\nstudents.  We very much would like Enron to present what we call a \"live\ncase study\" at the corporate conference on <underline>March 28,\n2001</underline>.\n\n\nYou, of course, are an obvious candidate to do this.  Alternatively, this\nis the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay\nand would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and\nthe Cornell community.  Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the\ncorporate conference are John Loose, President and COO of Corning, Ken\nChenault, incoming CEO of American Express, Marty Coyne, just announced\nPresident of Kodak's new Commercial Group.  Each of these leaders has a\ndistinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved in\ncontinually reinventing themselves in a fast-changing marketplace.  \n\n\nWe have several other speakers lined up for other parts of Leadership\nWeek, including Ken Blanchard and, we think, Abbey Cohen from Goldman\nSachs.  We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company\nand an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank\nRhodes, but these are still long shots.\n\n\nThe point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at the\nJohnson School and probably at Cornell next year.  If Jeff or Ken wanted\na platform for telling the Enron story, this would be a good one.  If\nthey can't do it, hopefully we could convince you to do it.  Again, the\ndate is March 28, 2001.       \n\n\nThe second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the same\nlines.  In fact, if we started working on the teaching case soon, it\ncould become the basis for the March conference live case study\npresentation.  We believe that Enron is unique in its ability to\nliterally create new markets.  The question is how do you lead and manage\nan organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in place\nthat you do, but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems to\nbe the case at Enron.  What kind of management philosophies, systems and\npractices make this possible.\n\n\nI know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in 1993 and around\n1997.  As I understand it neither focused on organizational and\nleadership issues.  We would like to devote a small research team to\nbuilding this case about Enron, directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyer\nfrom the ILR School.  We would need access to a number of people in the\nEnron organization, but are very aware of the demands on time for fast\nmoving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficient\nway.\n\n\nKevin, we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas and\nhopefully test them with your top leaders.  We will do anything we can to\nmake it feasible for Enron to engage with us on these two initiatives. \nPlease let me know what I can do to help you carry this forward.  As\nalways, thanks for your great personal support.\n\n\nDick\n\n\n\n",

  "text": "Jim:\nIt was a pleasure speaking with you on Wednesday.  Based on our conversatio=\nn,=20\nthis email includes the following:\n\nAn Enron contact to discuss developing small-scale generation on Tribal lan=\nds.\n\nOur views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on h=\now=20\nto remove those impediments.\n\nA description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWR=01,s ability=\n to=20\nsign contracts with power suppliers, and options to resolve them. Two=20\npossible options for addressing the credit issue are 1) a California PUC=20\norder clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through=20\nrates, and 2) an amendment to AB1X designed to accomplish the same goal.  I=\n=20\nhave attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and propose=\nd=20\namendments to AB1X.  We believe that an amendment to AB1X is the preferable=\n=20\noption.\n\nOur assessment of the supply/demand picture in California.\n\nOur suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near-=\n=20\nand long-term electricity crisis in California.  We will deliver to your=20\noffice today detailed legislative language.  In those materials we will als=\no=20\nidentify existing bills that we believe can easily accommodate our proposed=\n=20\nlanguage.\n\nI hope that the information is useful.  Please do not hesitate to contact m=\ne=20\nif you would like to discuss these materials further, or if there is anythi=\nng=20\nelse that I can do to assist you.\n\nRegards,\nKen Lay\n\n\n\nContact Information to Discuss Interest Expressed by Native American Tribes=\n=20\nin Installing Small-scale Generation on Tribal Lands\n\nDavid Parquet, Vice-President\nEnron North America\n101 California Street, Suite 1950\nSan Francisco, CA 94111\nPhone: 415.782.7820\nFax: 415.782.7851\n\n\n2. Key Barriers to Distributed Generation\n\nExcessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges\n\nSolution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took=\n a=20\nstep in the right direction.  Utility stand-by charges have always been=20\ndesigned by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract=20\nmonopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no reason to limit t=\nhe=20\nelimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than=20\n1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for=\n=20\nCalifornia to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc=\ne=20\nthe risk of black outs this summer.  We would propose lifting the cap by=20\noffering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development o=\nf=20\ndistributed generation.\n=20\nExcessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with=20\ninvestor-owned and municipal utilities\n\nSolution:   The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is =\na=20\nstep in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete=20\ninterconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this=\n=20\nrequirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed=20\ngeneration.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when=\n=20\ninterconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome=\n=20\nthrough executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent=20\npossible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th=\ne=20\nutility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be=20\naccomplished through amendments to SB 27X.\n\nPermitting and Air Quality Issues\nDevelopers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs=\n or=20\ngreater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an=\nd=20\ntherefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale=20\ngeneration faces. =20\n\nSolution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru=\n=20\nD-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant=\n=20\noutput apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facil=\nities.=20\nIn addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to=\n=20\nface local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial=20\ninterests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects=\n. =20\nThese objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.\n\n3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase=\n=20\nElectricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20\n\nEnron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with=\n=20\nsuppliers.\nEnron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th=\ne=20\ngoal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible.\nHowever, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk=\n=20\nconcerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.\nWe understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c=\nredit=20\nrisk concerns.\nEnron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and=\n=20\nis working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to=\n=20\nboth sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements=\n=20\ngoing forward.\n\nSummary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue\n\nAmbiguous Ratemaking Authority\nThe language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20\ncharge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our=\n=20\nanalysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20\nCalifornia PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  =\nAs=20\nsuch, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat=\nes=20\nadequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.\n\nAmbiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018\nThe language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public=\n=20\nUtilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are=\n=20\n=01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref=\nuse to=20\nallow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20\npurchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr=\nee=20\nto include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that=\n=20\nDWR has entered into with suppliers.\n=20\nAmbiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to=\n=20\nRecover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases\nIn addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority=\n=20\nnoted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to=\n=20\nthe specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl=\noy to=20\npermit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i=\ns=20\nextremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu=\nre=20\nDWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it =\nis=20\ndifficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in=\n=20\nrates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase=\n=20\ncosts.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since=\n=20\nsuppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover=\n=20\nfrom ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.\n\nOptions to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20\n\nWe have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri=\nsk=20\nissues.  We have identified three options:\n\nAmend AB1X\nThe amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the=\n=20\nPUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur=\nred by=20\nDWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary =\nto=20\nensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the=\n=20\npreferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political=\n=20\nchallenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file=20\nentitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.)\n\nClarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20\nthrough Contract Language\nThis is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20\nimplement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo=\nre=20\ntime to implement than the \"legislative\" fix.  We have attached electronic=\n=20\ncopies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC=\n=20\nwould need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled,=20\n=01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018)\n\nMake Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk\nAs indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac=\ncept=20\nother forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,=\n=20\ncash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have=\n=20\nindicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR=\n=20\nprefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through=\n=20\ncontract amendments.\n\n4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001\n\nBoth the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20\nAssociates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports=\n=20\nshowing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They diffe=\nr=20\nonly on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  Al=\nl=20\ncredible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer=\n=20\nof 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20\nlikely. =20\n\nCEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20\nsummer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our=20\nestimates.  California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,=\n well=20\nbelow the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio=\nn=20\nin the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power=\n=20\nthan other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20\nunpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t=\no=20\ndate. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t=\nhe=20\nflexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20\nCalifornia=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to =\nthis=20\nrequirement. =20\n\nOther reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early=\n=20\ndraw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve=\nre=20\nsupply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced=\n=20\nnumber of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20\nutilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren=\nt=20\npace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be=\n=20\nadded to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.\n\nCERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of=\n=20\nrolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more=20\noptimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000=\n=20\nMWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California=\n=20\nshould view the CEC's \"rosy scenario\" with considerable skepticism.\n\n5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California=\n=01,s=20\nElectricity Crisis\n\nThis email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We wil=\nl=20\ndeliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing=\n=20\nbills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.\n\nAs we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's=20\ncrisis must focus on four issues:\n\nIncrease supply\nDecrease demand\nEstablish a truly competitive retail electricity market\nReturn California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency\n\nIncrease supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)\nTo site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. =\n=20\nEnron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less=\n=20\nthan a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer.\n\nThe Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi=\nslation=20\nare steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve tho=\nse=20\nefforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face=\n=20\nin securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20\nrequirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron=01,s=\n=20\nproposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20\ntransfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an=20\ninnovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20\nemissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a=\nir=20\ndistricts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the=20\nrequired reductions in pollution emissions.\n\nDecrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)\nBecause of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing=\n=20\nthe supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the=\n=20\nbest chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished mo=\nst=20\neffectively and quickly in two ways:\n\nBuy-down demand\nCalifornia is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun=\nd=20\nto finance DWR=01,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand=\n more=20\neconomically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou=\nld=20\nbe willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,=\n=20\nthrough the summer months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to=20\ndetermine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To=20\nparticipate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment=20\nnecessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the=20\nreductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&D=\neal=20\nBench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.\n\nUse Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment\nTo be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:\n\nAn internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price=\n=20\nfor hour-ahead power in real time.=20\nReal-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment=\n=20\nverification.\nSettlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be=\n=20\npaid for load reduction (=01&Negawatts=018).\n\nThe potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ=\ne:\n\n=01&creation=018 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, parti=\ncularly=20\nin the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation=\n=20\nresources.\nreduction of  peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California=20\nelectric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity =\nin=20\nthe state.\nfostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris=\nk=20\nof hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to=20\ncustomers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for=\n=20\nresponding.=20\n\nWe estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in=\n=20\nexcess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for=\n=20\nsummer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.  We further estimate=\n=20\nthat the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time=\ns=20\nthat amount.  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates=20\ndirectly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and=20\ncontrol systems that would support load curtailment implementation.\n\nEstablish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehi=\ncle:=20\nSB27X\nThe only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we=\nre=20\ncustomers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy=\n=20\nservice providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from=\n=20\ncustomers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th=\ne=20\nprohibition against Direct Access.\n\nEnron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a=\n=20\ndirect access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department o=\nf=20\nWater Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from=\n=20\ncustomer migration. =20\n\nIn addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when=\n=20\nthe utility is removed completely from the procurement function.  Procureme=\nnt=20\nis not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial=20\ncondition in which the utilities now find themselves.  California should=20\ntherefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement=20\nfunction entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a=20\nnon-utility provider within 36 months.  To execute the transition, Californ=\nia=20\nshould hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period =\nin=20\nwhich competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments=\n=20\nof utility load.\n\nReturn California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency=01*Legislative =\nvehicle:=20\nAB18X\nUtility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand=\n. =20\nIn short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California=01,s supply-demand=20\nimbalance.  In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers=\n=20\nand businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ=\nia=20\nState government assume the role of =01&electricity buyer=018 for an extend=\ned=20\nperiod of time.  Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc=\ne=20\nin California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to=20\nparticipate in that market.\n\nCalifornia can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a=\n=20\nseries of staged rate increases.  California should design those rate=20\nincreases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without=\n=20\n=01&shocking=018 the economy or household budgets For example, California c=\nould=20\namortize the recovery of the utilities=01, past debt over a 5-10 year perio=\nd. =20\nIn addition, the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways:=\n=20\nFirst, the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in=20\nrecognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of =\nAB=20\n1890.  Second, California can =01&net=018 the revenues the utilities have r=\neceived=20\nfrom selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they hav=\ne=20\naccrued due to the retail price cap.\n\n ",

You might \nremember that Ralph Hodge had indicated to you that you may well be hearing \nfrom the Ghanaian Ambassador.  Ralph believes that he will try to facilitate \na meeting between you and Chevron.\n\nWe have been working Ghana pretty hard, including the West African Gas \nPipeline, the Effasu Power Project, a marketing company and a host of other \npossibilities.  We have told the Ghanaians that with what is going on right \nnow in Nigeria, the loss of projects in Cote d'Ivoire due to the coup d'etat, \nand the lack of speed in moving forward in Ghana , that we are slowing down a \nbit to determine if we can resolve current projects before taking on \nadditional ones.  \n\nClearly this is a bit of a \"cop out\".  I am reluctant to tell Ghana that we \nare slowing down generally in Africa because I don't want to hurt the barge \ndeal or jepordize the possible resolution of the large snowball in Mozambique \nand there is truth to the Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria issues.  And, of course, \nI don't want to alienate Ghana generally.  I have a good relationship with \nthe Ambassador from Ghana, in fact, I just got a postcard from him two days \nago, and when he returns to the US he has indicated that he will call me.  I \nwill deliver this message, hopefully diverting the call to you.

I can only say that it\nwas a tremendous success, and everyone should be congratulated that worked\non the planning!\nNow to the final items.  We are billing everyone for the hotel, golf and\nregatta this week and we have a few questions.  The hotel and golf are easy.\nHowever the regatta is a different situation.  When we started this project,\nthe cost of the regatta was much less than when we finished.  We quoted\n$85.00 per person, however the Millennium rate was actually $100.00 per\nperson.  This would not be such a great problem, however we had 33 no-shows\nfor the regatta.  This being said, we have two choices.  We bill those that\nsailed for an additional $15.00 to make their charge $100.00 which then\nleaves us with a negative $3500.00.  Or, we also bill the 33 no-shows for\n$100.00 each which puts us pretty close to break even.\nIn the big picture, there have been some budget cost that were less than\nexpected and some that were more.  We will have the final budget complete by\nthe end of next week.\nThe most important issue, is it acceptable to bill those that sailed $100.00\nor do you want us to stay at the original price of $85.00?......Then, of\ncourse, what should we do about the no shows?  Possibly bill them a\ncancellation fee or the full fee?  Or, forget and forgive this time?\nI am leaving for Paradise tomorrow, however my trusted partner Janelle will\nbe here until the 20th of January.  We would like to get everything\nfinalized before she leaves.\nGive us your thoughts.\n\nThe EX-MC Director\nSharon\n\n",

As a result oil prices pushed\nslightly higher with NYMEX crude trading at $26.80 and IPEC crude trading at\n25.06. OPEC ministers have indicated that members have highlighted $25/bbl\nas a price that they feel comfortable with.The decreases per country were as\nfollows:\n\nAlgeria - 32,000\nIndonesia - 52,000\nIran - 146,000\nKuwait - 80,000\nLibya - 54,000\nNigeria - 82,000\nQatar - 26,000\nSaudi Arabia - 324,000\nUAE - 88,000\nVenezuela - 116,000\nTotal - 1,000,000\n\n\nENERGY AFRICA LOOK TOWARD THE MOROCCAN DEEP\nRabat - This week the MENA Petroleum Bulletin spoke with Andrew Windham,\nGroup General Counsel for Energy Africa. Amina Benkhadra, General Manager of\nONAREP (25%) added to the growing list of re-entrants to Morocco, signing a\npetroleum agreement with Energy Africa (63.75%) and Taurus Petroleum AB\n(11.25%). This agreement, taking effect March 1st 2001, concerned three\nexploration permits offshore Morocco collectively known as the Tiznit\nOffshore area.\nEnergy Africa Morocco Ltd (operator), together with Taurus Petroleum\n(co-partner) will implement exploration work on the three permits of the\nTiznit Offshore area covering approximately 6000sq.km. This is Energy\nAfrica's second Petroleum Agreement covering acreage offshore Morocco, the\nfirst being the Cap Draa Haute Mer area where Energy Africa holds 20% equity\nbringing the total acreage held by it in the country to 18,000sq.km.\nAndrew Windham, said, 'the country has all the characteristics offshore\nwhich make potentially, for substantial discoveries. But at this stage it is\nvery much untried and untested, so it is a very exciting place to be at the\nmoment. We are in right at the start of some new plays.'\nFor further details please see the April issue of the MENA Petroleum\nBulletin.\n\n\nREPSOL MAKE 2ND LIBYA DISCOVERY\nLondon - Repsol YPF SA said it discovered oil at a second well during\nexploration in Libya. The well in the Murzuq Basin, 800km south of Tripoli,\nproduced oil at a rate of 1,300bbl/d, the company said in a press release.\nRepsol is testing the site on behalf of a consortium including OMV,\nTotalFinaElf and Saga Petroleum. Repsol began searching for oil in the area\nin May 1998, when the Libyan government granted approval for exploration and\nproduction sharing arrangements with foreign companies.

DeLay has requested support from and\ninteraction with the BCCA and the Partnership on that day.\n\nAPRIL 6TH ACTIVITY  After time spent early in the day in Mr. DeLay's\ncongressional district to meet with Brazoria and Fort Bend County local\nofficials, Mr. DeLay has asked us to then pick up the itinerary with a ship\nchannel tour and presentations on SIP status, science and modeling issues.\nWe are working closely with Mr. DeLay's staff on all these matters.\n\nHe has asked to end the day with a \"small dinner with CEOs\" to have a frank\ndiscussion about our clean air issues.  This is the dinner my staff called\nyour office about on Friday.  Clearly, Mr. DeLay is interested in what he\nand the other congressmen may be able to due legislatively to assist in\naddressing some of the issues we have with the SIP.   He has asked that we\nalso invite Governor Perry to attend the dinner, which we are doing.  Mr.\nDeLay will call the Governor to encourage his attendance.  This will\nobviously be a critical opportunity to relay targeted information and advise\non strategy with key members of Congress and the Governor.  Everyone in\nattendance at the dinner will be provided coordinated talking points in\nadvance.  There may also be a formal briefing arranged immediately before or\nafter the April 3 Partnership Board meeting so we can prep in advance.\n\nRSVPs TO DATE  Responses so far indicate that Steve Miller, Ed Galante, Jim\nEdmonds and Jim Kollaer are confirmed to attend the dinner.  Charles Duncan\nand Kelly Frels are checking calendars.  Ken Lay, Steve Letbetter and Dan\nSmith are unavailable.  We do not have a commitment yet from the Governor.\nWe will likely recruit two or three other CEOs from BCCA member companies to\nattend the dinner.\n\nMy current thought is to house the members of Congress at the St. Regis and\nto arrange the dinner either at the River Oaks Country Club or possibly at a\nboard member's home nearby.\n\nI trust this additional information is useful to you.  I will be the\nPartnership point person on this -- please do not hesitate to call me with\nany questions you may have.  Thank you.\n\nAnne Culver\nSr. VP, Government Relations\nGreater Houston Partnership\n713/844-3624 (ph)\n713/844-0224 (fax)\naculver@houston.org\n\nVisit our website at www.houston.org\n\n\n",

The report finds that energy efficiency for buildings,\ntransportation, and industry could account for more than half of the\npotential greenhouse gas reductions achievable by 2020. Natural gas\ntechnologies, more efficient power plant technologies, and combined heat an=\nd\npower play an important role in reducing fossil energy power plant\nemissions. And \"low-carbon energy systems,\" such as renewable energy, can\nalso make an important contribution. Perhaps equally important is the\nfinding that there is \"no single path to a low emission future.\"\n\nRead more:\nwww.unep.ch/ipcc/ <http://www.unep.ch/ipcc/>\n\n--------------------------------\n\nBarriers to Energy Efficiency In Public, Private Organizations\n\nThere is a gap between the opportunities for cost-effective energy-\nefficiency investment identified in energy models and the levels actually\nseen in practice, according to SPRU, a science and technology policy\nresearch group in England. The origins of the gap are claimed to lie in a\nseries of barriers, such as lack of capital, lack of information or hidden\ncosts, which prevent markets for energy and energy-using technologies from\noperating efficiently.  SPRU says that understanding the size and nature of\nthis gap is essential if policies to mitigate climate change through\nimproved energy efficiency are to be successful. These policies must succee=\nd\nin the context of liberalizing energy markets and increasing interest in th=\ne\ndevelopment of a broadly based energy service industry.\n\nRead more:\nwww.sussex.ac.uk/spru/environment/research/barriers.html\n<http://www.sussex.ac.uk/spru/environment/research/barriers.html>\n\n--------------------------------\n\nState of the World Report\n\nFrom the thinning of the Arctic sea ice to the invasion of the\nmosquito-borne West Nile virus, the Worldwatch Institute's State of the\nWorld 2001 shows how the economic boom of the last decade has damaged\nnatural systems.

This area accounts for almost 50,000 housing starts a year, more\nthan are built in 42 states.  One of the main reasons for adopting the code\nis the area's commitment to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as part of the\nTexas state plan for controlling smog.  Since the IECC contains a new\nstandard for reducing window solar heat gain, which reduces air conditionin=\ng\nenergy use substantially, it cuts NOx emissions from the power plants that\nserve the air conditioning load.  The Alliance supported Public Citizen, th=\ne\nTexas Building Energy Institute, the Sustainable Living Alliance, NCTCOG\nstaff, and others in this effort, working with the Building Codes Assistanc=\ne\nProject and Alliance Associates.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nAlliance Associates Honored with Awards\n\nMany Alliance Associates were honored at the 2001 Energy Star Awards\nCeremony, hosted by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the\nDepartment of Energy.

DeLay has requested support from and\ninteraction with the BCCA and the Partnership on that day.\n\nAPRIL 6TH ACTIVITY  After time spent early in the day in Mr. DeLay's\ncongressional district to meet with Brazoria and Fort Bend County local\nofficials, Mr. DeLay has asked us to then pick up the itinerary with a ship\nchannel tour and presentations on SIP status, science and modeling issues.\nWe are working closely with Mr. DeLay's staff on all these matters.\n\nHe has asked to end the day with a \"small dinner with CEOs\" to have a frank\ndiscussion about our clean air issues.  This is the dinner my staff called\nyour office about on Friday.  Clearly, Mr. DeLay is interested in what he\nand the other congressmen may be able to due legislatively to assist in\naddressing some of the issues we have with the SIP.   He has asked that we\nalso invite Governor Perry to attend the dinner, which we are doing.  Mr.\nDeLay will call the Governor to encourage his attendance.  This will\nobviously be a critical opportunity to relay targeted information and\nadvise\non strategy with key members of Congress and the Governor.  Everyone in\nattendance at the dinner will be provided coordinated talking points in\nadvance.  There may also be a formal briefing arranged immediately before\nor\nafter the April 3 Partnership Board meeting so we can prep in advance.\n\nRSVPs TO DATE  Responses so far indicate that Steve Miller, Ed Galante, Jim\nEdmonds and Jim Kollaer are confirmed to attend the dinner.  Charles Duncan\nand Kelly Frels are checking calendars.  Ken Lay, Steve Letbetter and Dan\nSmith are unavailable.  We do not have a commitment yet from the Governor.\nWe will likely recruit two or three other CEOs from BCCA member companies\nto\nattend the dinner.\n\nMy current thought is to house the members of Congress at the St. Regis and\nto arrange the dinner either at the River Oaks Country Club or possibly at\na\nboard member's home nearby.\n\nI trust this additional information is useful to you.  I will be the\nPartnership point person on this -- please do not hesitate to call me with\nany questions you may have.  Thank you.\n\nAnne Culver\nSr. VP, Government Relations\nGreater Houston Partnership\n713/844-3624 (ph)\n713/844-0224 (fax)\naculver@houston.org\n\nVisit our website at www.houston.org\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Thanks  \nvery much, though, for taking a look at it.\n?\nI have one follow-up question for you -- could you recommend another Enron  \nexecutive that might be a candidate for such an opportunity?? \n?\nTo help you answer the question, the company is Juno Online?Services,  \nInc.?(NASDAQ: JWEB), a leading US ISP.? Juno is very interested in  working \nwith (and in advanced-stage discussions with) companies in the energy  \nindustry and working with them on strategic telecommunications and marketing  \npartnerships.\n?\nInformation about Juno is available at \"About Juno\" on Juno's Web site \nhttp://www.juno.com.? I've also attached an  executive summary to update you \n(or the relevant person at Enron) as to the  current status of Juno's \nbusiness.\n?\nThanks very much for your assistance, and I hope that this message finds  you \nwell.\n?\nBest,\n?\nToby\n?\nExecutive Overview of?Juno --\n\nThe company finished 4Q00 w/ $56MM in cash.? Total net loss for 2001  was \nprojected to be $10-$25MM, as the company focuses on billable services,  \ncontinues to reduce expenses, and looks to develop advertising and other  \nancillary revenue streams.? The company is confident that it can meet  \nor?beat the loss target and made explicit statements that on-hand cash  \nresources are \"more than adequate\" to get the business profitable.? The  \ncompany has not publicly given a time-line for profitability to maintain  \nflexibility.  \nThe company controls one of the largest dialup subscriber audiences (4MM  \nactive subscribers as of 4Q00, 850K of whom are billable) on the Internet  \ntoday and is the 4th largest US ISP (after AOL, ELNK, and MSN).  \n2000 revenue came in at $114MM, 65% of which was derived from subscription  \nfees and 35% from advertising.? 2001 revenues are expected to come in  \nbetween $100MM-$120MM, with the revenue mix moving toward 80% subscription \nand  20% advertising due to increased focus on billable services and the \nsoft  Internet advertising markets.  \nJuno has announced broadband agreements for its Juno Express product  \ncovering all mainstream broadband transport platforms -- AT&T Broadband,  \nTime Warner Cable, and Comcast (cable); Covad (DSL); Hughes (satellite); and  \nMetricom (wireless).  \nThe company has announced wireless distribution agreements for it's Juno  \nMobile product with Palm and Sprint PCS.? Other agreements are likely to  be \nforthcoming.  \nThe company has powerful propietary technology assets that give it a  \ncompetitive advantage.? The company has launched (internally but not  \npublicly) a new business unit -- Juno Solutions -- to investigate the  \nopportunity to license these technology assets to third parties both  \ndomestically and internationally.?  \nThe Juno Virtual Supercomputer Project represents another example of  Juno's \nefforts to develop ancillary revenue streams.? This distributed  computing \ninitiative aims to leverage unused computer processing power from  Juno's MMs \nof subscribers, aggregating it for sale to biotech, pharmaceutical,  and \ncomputational chemistry firms.? \nhttp://www.juno.com/corp/news/supercomputer.html\n\n\n=============\nToby  Bryce\n(347) 200-0882\nbryce@juno.com\n=============\n?\nOn Wed, 14 Mar 2001 16:52:52 -0500 Toby Bryce <bryce@juno.com> writes:\n> Mr.  Lay,\n> \n> I am contacting you (per instructions of Rosalee) with a  director \n> opportunity with a NASDAQ-listed Internet media firm.?

Len Baker may feel that the\nlanguage on Safe Harbor doesn't go far enough.

(Most of the group feels this\napproach is too close to asking the SEC to mandate change.)  Baruch also\nfeels that in relying so much on voluntary disclosure, we are exaggerating\nwhat companies will, in fact, disclose. My suggestion, Len and Baruch, is to\nwrite a paragraph or two for Attachment D, if you wish.  Hopefully, both of\nyou will begin with a sentence supporting the report in general, but if you\nfeel strongly that the report doesn't reflect all your views, please do\nstate them for the record.\n\n  Before we schedule a final call for last minute details,\netc,  I'd like to request an e-mail, fax or phone call from each of you\nletting me know if you can sign-off on the report.

Is the 3:00 p.m. panel on \nMonday or Tuesday?\n\nThanks.\n\nRosalee\n\n\n\n\n\"PERSHING Jonathan, IEA/LTO\" <Jonathan.PERSHING@iea.org> on 04/24/2001 \n11:08:56 AM\nTo: \"'Kenneth.Lay@enron.com'\" <Kenneth.Lay@enron.com>\ncc:  \nSubject: RE: for Rosalee - re Mr. Lay's participation at IEA ministerial\n\n\nDear Rosalee,\n\n I would again like to thank Mr Lay for agreeing to take part in both\nour IEA ministerial session and in the OECD Forum 2001 - Sustainable\nDevelopment and the New Economy.  As discussed, he is to chair the first of\ntwo energy panels at the FORUM; his is titled \"Fuelling Sustainable\nDevelopment\".  On his panel will be Mr Kurt Yeager of EPRI (speaking on\nhydrocarbon issues), Mr Luis Echavarri, the head of the OECD's Nuclear\nEnergy Agency (speaking on nuclear power), and Danish Minister of Energy and\nEnvironment, Svend Auken (speaking on renewables and energy efficiency).\nThe panel is scheduled to take place starting at 3pm at the Cit, des\nSciences et de l'Industrie, in La Villete, in northern Paris.\n\nAs I believe I noted in our previous e-mail communications, while the IEA is\nresponsible for organising our ministerial session and the substantive\nissues related to the energy panels on the FORUM, the OECD is doing the\nFORUM logistics.  They have therefore asked that I forward to all speakers\nthe following note (see below). It asks that Mr Lay provide a number of\nlogistical inputs, including a biography and photo, as well as information\non any remarks he might choose to make. I note that as the chair of the\nfirst energy panel, he may not wish to make a formal presentation -- but\ntime does permit this if he wishes, and the decision is at his discretion.\nI would appreciate being a cc on any material you send to the OECD so we can\nkeep our files current.\n\nOn our own side, the IEA concluded its Governing Board Meeting last Friday,\nand finally approved the ministerial session agenda and arrangements.  While\nMr Priddle will be sending out a formal invitation and set of background\ndocuments to Mr Lay this week, I wanted to give you a heads up and find out\nif you had any \"last-minute\" questions which I might help answer.\n\nIn addition, I note that your last e-mail indicated Mrs Lay will be in Paris\nduring our session.  Some of our ministerial representatives are also\nplanning to bring spouses (in particular US Energy Secretary Abraham, who is\ncoming with his wife) -- do you think Mrs Lay might wish to participate in\nany events during this period with any of these others?  If you let us know,\nwe would be happy to make arrangements.\n\nAlso, please let us know if others will be travelling with Mr Lay, and if we\nmight facilitate their logistics.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nJonathan Pershing\n\n________________________\nJonathan C.

Unfortunately, the process was slowed when our primary contact at \nSmith Graham, Gabriel Hayes, left the firm earlier this year.  We have since \nreestablished discussions and the Global Finance Group is preparing a \nproposal that a portion (about $30 million) of the Enron Cash Balance Plan \nportfolio be dedicated to an emerging managers portfolio.  One-third of this \nmoney ($10 million) would be invested in bonds, which could be placed with \nSmith Graham, as the fixed-income manager .  (Total Plan assets are about \n$235 million.)\n\nThe proposal will be submitted to the Plan Administrative Committee at its \nquarterly meeting on May 3rd.  The proposal should be well received as the \nCommittiee has previously requested that  we optimize our existing allocation \nto minority money managers.  Gerald Smith has been advised that Enron is \nlooking at ways to allocate money to the firm, and that a decision should be \nreached sometime in May.  We have not communicated the specific details of \nour intentions as of yet pending the outcome of the May 3rd meeting.\n\nI am available for further discussion at your convenience.\n\nRegards,\nTim DeSpain\n(x31770)\n\n",

As you probably know, the State of Maharastra has been slow \npaying and no paying for the electricity from our plant at Dabohl for \nsometime and more recently both the State of Maharastra  and the Government \nof India have refused to honor their government guarantees on this project.  \nWe have filed a political force majeure on the project and indeed will be \nmoving into arbitration on that and a number of other issues in London in the \nnot too distant future.  Again, I believe this will send a very negative \nsignal to the market place as to the advisability of international companies \ninvesting in India.  I would think you might want to build one panel around \nthis subject.  \n\n If there's any way we can be of help, let me know.\n\nBest regards,\n\nKen Lay\n\n\n\n\n\"Colette Mathur, Director\" <indiasummit@weforum.org> on 04/24/2001 09:44:29 AM\nTo: \"klay@enron.com\" <klay@enron.com>\ncc:  \nSubject: India Economic Summit 2001, New Delhi 2-4 December\n\n\nTo the attention of:\nDr Kenneth L. Lay\nChairman\nEnron\n\n\nDear Dr Lay,\n\nWhen the Minister of Finance of India Yashwant Sinha recently presented the\n2001-2002 national budget, it was widely acknowledged as a very ambitious\n\"dream budget\" which puts India on a high growth trajectory. Most key\nsectors should benefit from these reforms, which will thus give a new boost\nto the country's economic and social progress. As such, the budget was\nwelcomed with great enthusiasm by the Indian and international business\ncommunity.\n\nOn the occasion of our India Economic Summit 2001 to be held in partnership\nwith the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) from 2 to 4 December in New\nDelhi, it will be the perfect time to assess the progress of the bold and\nextensive measures proposed in the recent budget, how they have been\nimplemented and how they have impacted the business environment, domestic\nindustry activity and foreign investment.\n\nAs we will soon be preparing the preliminary programme of the Summit, I\nwould like to take the opportunity to benefit from your expertise and\nunderstanding of the country. I would greatly appreciate receiving from you\nany particular topics or issues that you wish to see given priority on the\nagenda. Any suggestions of relevant speakers or experts that you may have\nwould also be welcomed.\n\nI look forward to receiving your response at the above e-mail address and\nkindly ask you to copy my colleague Mitra Khoubrou (e-mail:\nmitra.khoubrou@weforum.org).\n\nFor more information on the 2001-2002 Union Budget, please visit the\nwebsite of the Ministry of Finance of India at http://finmin.nic.in/fub.htm\n\nI look forward to hearing from you and hope that you will be with us in\nIndia again next December.\n\nBest regards,\n\nColette Mathur,\nDirector,\nCenter for Regional Strategies\nWorld Economic Forum\n\n\n",

What time is the meeting?\n\nRosie\n\n\nTo: Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron@ENRON\ncc:  \nSubject: EGM - all company meeting\n\nKen,\n\nPer my voicemail, we are having an all employee meeting on next Monday at the \nHyatt Regency.  The purpose of this meeting is to pull everyone together for \nan update on EGM and a brief presentation from all the business units within \nEGM.  This includes about 1 hour of business and then drinks and food - we \nexpect about 500 people.  \n\nWe have made a lot of progress on changing the nature and profitability of \nthese businesses and we want to make sure everyone sees just how far we have \ncome in a few months.  \n\nI believe they will be motivated to see the growth and profitability.  We had \na record Q1 with $100 million of gross margin.  That was 50% of what they \nmade in all of 2000.  Combined with the fact that in December of 2000 alone \nwe made $87 million in gross margin, I believe it will have a big impact.\n\nIf you could attend the meeting even for a few minutes it would go a long way \nin helping us drive our other point which is that the EGM businesses are now \ncore to Enron and has the attention of both you and Jeff.\n\nThanks for considering this and let me know if you need any other information \nor assistance.\n\nMike \n\n",

dusted off (yes, he is actually camping at the \nfairgrounds in LaGrange!).  Now all our fearless leader (and incidentally, \nthe National Multiple Sclerosis Society's 2000 Man of the Year), Jeff \nSkilling, needs is your help in raising money for MS.\n\nEnron's MS150 Dream Team is bigger than some townships in these parts - over \n350 Enron employees, led by Jeff, will ride from Houston to Austin under the \nEnron Flag April 15-16, and the team's goal is to raise $350,000.  I am \nchallenging (is begging a better word?) each of you to pledge a certain \namount per mile - i.e., $1, $2, $5, it's your call.  I'll even give you a \nbreak on the calculation and use 150 miles, even though Jeff swears it's \ncloser to 170 miles (you know how he is with numbers).  Of course, a flat \npledge is also appreciated.  And don't forget, Enron will match your pledge \nto this very worthy cause 1-1.\n\nI hope you will join the team and help Enron maintain its status as the top \nmoney raiser of all MS150 rides in the NATION!  Thank you for your \nconsideration.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call me.\n\nSherri x3-5984\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The lawsuit has been filed by a Plaintiff who is represented\nby one of the law firms which has filed suit against i2 in the class action\nlawsuit (i.e. the Nike situation).  The Plaintiff in this lawsuit is a\nnominal shareholder and acts as a front for the Plaintiff law firm.\n\nWhat makes the lawsuit different from the class action is that it is a\nshareholder derivative lawsuit.  What this means is that the plaintiff\nshareholder has filed the lawsuit against each of you to collect damages on\nbehalf of i2.  The claim is based on the Nike facts, but the Plaintiff is\nclaiming i2 has been damaged by your actions.   What is interesting is that\nall damages recovered would go to i2.  So why the lawsuit?  The Plaintiff\ncan recover for all legal fees he incurs in bringing the lawsuit.\nDerivative actions commonly follow class action filings, as a sort of\n\"tag-along\" type of action.\n\nThe Plaintiff attorney has requested that i2 accept service of the lawsuit\non your behalf.  Normally, I would say no and let the Plaintiff law firm\ntry and track you down, but they may try and serve you at an inappropriate\ntime, i.e. client meeting, during a speech.  Please let me know if you\nwould like for us to accept service on your behalf.  This is very common\npractice.\n\nI will send each of you a copy of the lawsuit.  Needless to say, you are\nindemnified for this, i2 will pay for all legal fees incurred to defend you\nand i2 does have insurance to cover this matter.\n\nPlease let me know of your decision to have i2 accept service on your\nbehalf.\n\nThanks\n\n\nBob Donohoo\nCorporate Counsel\ni2 Technologies, Inc.\n\nThis message and the documents attached to it, if any, is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee and may contain information that may be PRIVILEGED\nand CONFIDENTIAL, and/or may contain ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT.

I told him that it might\nprove valuable for his son's campaign!  When we spoke with Cynthia Sandherr in\nWashington a week or so ago, she said that the \"Digital Divide\" was the \nhottest\ntopic on Capital Hill.  She had some wonderful ideas on how to spin this so \nthat\nbusinesses create the bridge for the divide and not government!  Although we\nwant to stay nonpartisan with TFA, this would be a wonderful press opportunity\nand platform in Washington!\n\nJust thought I should give you \"heads-up\" in case he asks and please tell \nLinda\nI said hello!\n\nThank you for doing so much for the cause!\n\n\nTerry Pierce\nEnron Broadband Services\nCorporate Marketing\nSr. Manager/Special Projects\n(713)345-8383 Office\n(713) 503-0700 Cell\n\n\n\n\n",

Awareness of Environmental Issue\n1)   Environmental issue, like Global warming, Excessive use of\nnatural resources, Recycling, Pollution, is of major significance.\nThe impact on the business is becoming to increase.\n2)   The Kyoto Conference(COP3) defined an international framework\nfor dealing with the issue of global warming.\n(The GHG reduction targets contained in the Kyoto Protocol are 6%\nfor Japan, 7% for the U.S.A., 8% for the EU)\nSpecific content for the Flexibility Mechanism/Kyoto Mechanism\n(for International Emissions Trading (IET), Joint Implement (JI),\nand Clean Development Mechanism(CDM)) will be decided on at COP6,\nwhich is scheduled for November 2000.\n     GHG is a serious matter requiring a globally studying.\n\n2. GHG Reduction\n1)   The relationship between GHG levels and climatic change\nremains uncertain at present and further research is required.\nPolicies will have to be devised that take account of developments\nin scientific knowledge and opinion and that also maintains\nflexibility.\n2)   Policy on GHG reduction must reflect the circumstances of\neach country and be based on a combination of regulatory measures,\neconomic measures and voluntary measures.\n     Excessive regulating may cause the unfairness in business\ncompetition.\n\n3. Energy Conservation\n1)   The U.S.A. is the largest consumer of energy. In such a\nlarge, mobile country, much\nconsumption is accounted for by the transportation sector.\n2)   The EU has pushed many advances in environmental protection,\nand has seen considerable progress in the use of renewable energy.\n\n3)   Japan has very limited natural resources, and energy\nconservation has been promoted since the oil shocks of the 1970s.\nAs a result, Japan is a leader in making effective use of energy,\nand has the lowest level of GHG emissions against GDP.\nJapan's policy is to combine regulation with voluntary measures.\nIndustry has supported this by promoting voluntary environmental\nplans and other measures.\nJapanese industries including Toshiba are to improve the energy\nconsumption efficiency of their products and use of energy at\ntheir factories.\n\n4. Programme of Industry\n1)   Energy conservation is to make up the cost reduction of\nproducts and recycling will bring about the effect on manufacturing\ncost saving in the long run.\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n(See attached file: Einvironmentalissue0118.doc)\n\n   Hitoshi Misaki, Group Manager\n   Relations-Group,\n   International Division TOSHIBA CORPORATION\n   1-1,Shibaura 1-chome Minatoku Tokyo\n   JAPAN 105-8001\n   TEL:03-3457-3661, FAX:03-5444-9217\n   e-mail:hitoshi misaki@toshiba.co.jp\n   YES T can !\n\n - Einvironmentalissue0118.doc\n\n",

  "text": "Jeff, I will definitely show this to Mr. Lay.  However, I had a thought.  Why \ndon't you draft what you'd like him to say and then he can make changes to it \nas he wishes.  That would really be helpful.\n\nThanks.\n\nRosalee\n\n\n\n\nJeffrey McClellan@ECT\n04/28/2000 03:21 PM\nTo: Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron@ENRON\ncc:  \nSubject: Cougars @ Enron\n\nKen,\nThank you for the opportunity to meet today at the \"Enron Teaching Excellence \nAwards.\"  It was an indeed an honor and a privilege to finally speak to you \nin person.  Ironically, when I returned to the office today I received your \ninteroffice mail concerning the below email.  I certainly understand that you \nwill not be able to attend many events as I am sure that your schedule is \nquite demanding.  I believe that this group will benefit substantially by \nknowing that you are aware that it exists and want to support it.  Is it \npossible to send a brief email to UH alumni at Enron letting them know as \nsuch?  If the alumni see that you support our efforts, they will take an \nincreased interest in participating and provide us a solid foundation with \nwhich to work.  Please provide me any feedback you may have.\n\nAs we talked about today, we would like to begin having occasional \"brown \nbags\" in an effort to get the alumni better acquainted with the university.  \nI believe that we should have one with Dr. Smith to promote the image \ncampaign, changes at the university, the tier 1 status, etc.  If you could \nmake it that would be great but if not that is OK as well.  I will send you \nthe date when I have it.\n\nChet Gladchuk has agreed to work with us to orchestrate a tailgate party on \nSept. 16th to welcome Dana Dimel in his first home football game.  We will \nhave a tent, food, refreshments, football tickets, etc.  I suspect that it \nwill be from approx. 4:00 PM to 10:00 PM.  Please let me know if your \ncalendar is free.\n\nI am truly excited to have you as alumni and am grateful for your \napproachability.  Please let me stress that I do not expect you to make all \nor even most of our events.  I would just like to let you know what we are \ndoing and if you find that you are free, we would love to have you.\n\nThank you for your time,\nJeff\n---------------------- Forwarded by Jeffrey McClellan/HOU/ECT on 04/28/2000 \n02:48 PM ---------------------------\n\n\nJeffrey McClellan\n04/12/2000 05:10 PM\nTo: Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron@ENRON\ncc:  \nSubject: Cougars @ Enron\n\nMr. Lay,\nMy name is Jeff McClellan and I am President of the \"Cougars @ Enron\".  We \nare a group of Enron employees that are UH alumni that have banded together \nto form a chartered extension of the Houston Alumni Organization.  We had our \nkickoff event in the 50th floor dining room on March 7th of this year and \nhave received substantial interest in our organization.  I wanted to drop you \na line to tell you not only about us, but also what we are doing.  As of \ntoday, we have 107 employees that have expressed interest in contributing to \nour group's success. We have several stated objectives:\n\n1. Network Enron Cougars together to build strong working relationships.  \nThis will benefit the employees as well as the company.\n2. Raise and present scholarships to Enron dependents to attend the \nUniversity of Houston.  This will help to ease education costs.\n3. Assist the company in its recruiting efforts concerning the university.\n4. Assist the university through financial gifts whenever possible.\n\nCurrently, here is what we have planned:\n\n4/15/2000 The HAO has given us their hall at \"Frontier Fiesta\".   Frontier \nFiesta is a festival thrown by the students and alumni that provides good \nfamily   fun. The HAO is having it catered and everyone is invited.\n\n9/16/2000 We are throwing a tailgate party to celebrate Dana Dimel's first \nhome football game against Army.  We are working with Chet Gladchuk to set up \na   tent, have it catered, listen to a live band, football tickets, etc.  We \nwould like to make this event open to all of Enron if possible.  The \nuniversity will   provide Enron special recognition on both the Cougar Vision \nScoreboard and over the PA in both the first and second half of the contest.\n\nThese are the confirmed events so far as we are still in the opening stages.  \nWe anticipate to have more events planned (golf tournament) which I would \nlike the opportunity to share with you.  This group is designed to cater to \nits members, the company, and the university and I believe it is going to be \none of the most successful out there.  To achieve such a plateau, however, we \nneed to be a continuous draw to old and new alumni alike.  To have you as an \nalumni is truly a monumental draw to our employees and the university.  Would \nyou consider making several appearances with us at our events?  Your \nparticipation would greatly increase our exposure and ability to accomplish \nour goals and we would love the chance to honor you as one of our most \ndistinguished alumni.  If there are any suggestions that you may have as to \nhow to further our group, I would love to hear them.  I understand that you \nare extremely busy and I do not wish to monopolize your time but this alumni \ncharter is something that I truly believe in and I hope you will agree that \nit has great potential.  With you support, we can attain a level of success \nthat will set us aside from any other group.\n\nThank you for your time,\nJeff\n\n\n\n\n",

In fact he has also requested you personally whether you \ncan arrange a meeting with Bill Gates while he is there. That would probably \nbe impossible given everyone's schedule there and my message for that to the \nCM is going to be that eaxctly that... the schedules look impossible to \narrange that.\n\nHowever for your meeting, I would appreciate giving us some time.\n\nRegards,\nSanjay\n\n",

(NASDAQ: INTU\n> <http://www.quicken.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=INTU>) announced today\n> that its board of directors has selected Stephen M. Bennett as president\n> and chief executive officer. Bennett assumes his responsibilities\n> immediately, succeeding Bill Campbell, who had been acting chief executive\n> since September. Campbell is retiring from day-to-day responsibilities but\n> will remain chairman of the board of directors. Bennett was also named to\n> the board.\n> Bennett, 45, was most recently an executive vice president and member of\n> the Office of the CEO at GE Capital, the financial services subsidiary of\n> General Electric Corp. GE Capital is the world leader in numerous\n> financial industries, including private label credit cards, commercial\n> equipment leasing and vendor finance. With $330 billion in assets, GE\n> Capital provides 42% of General Electric's overall profits and is among\n> the world's largest non-banking financial institutions.\n> \"Steve is an outstanding leader from a company renowned for strong\n> leadership,\" said Campbell. \"His experience is tailor-made to fit Intuit's\n> needs now and in the future. We wanted someone with service industry\n> knowledge, who had led large, complex organizations and with proven\n> ability to produce fast growth. Steve is the ideal choice to take Intuit\n> to the multi-billion dollar level.\"\n> \"Intuit is the leader in e-finance. Quicken.com is already the leader in\n> online tax preparation and online mortgage origination,\" said Bennett, who\n> will relocate from Connecticut to the Bay Area. \"I'm excited to have the\n> opportunity to continue developing services for the Internet and take\n> Intuit's industry leadership to new heights.\"\n> During his GE career, Bennett held significant leadership positions in six\n> different businesses within the company, spanning both manufacturing and\n> financial services. In his most recent position, he oversaw a portfolio of\n> five different companies whose more than 20,000 employees last year\n> generated $15 billion in annual volume. Prior to that, as president and\n> CEO of GE Capital e-Business, he pioneered the company's efforts to\n> leverage the Internet across GE Capital's worldwide portfolio of\n> businesses.\n> Previously he delivered significant growth as the president and CEO of GE\n> Capital's more than 4,000-employee Vendor Financial Services business.\n> Under his leadership, assets grew to more than $13 billion from $5 billion\n> and net income increased to $200 million from $80 million in four years.\n> Intuit board member John Doerr said he was impressed by Bennett's broad\n> base of experience. \"Steve knows business-to-business as well as\n> business-to-consumer. He knows service businesses. And he gets the Net.\n> Intuit's product leadership and Steve's ability to grow businesses are an\n> ideal match for our future.\"\n> Bennett added, \"Intuit's management team is strong, stable and experienced\n> and works well together,\" he said. \"This is one of the few management\n> teams to successfully and rapidly transform a company to the Net. I'm glad\n> to have the opportunity to lead Intuit's continued growth and expansion.\"\n> Scott Cook, Intuit founder and chairman of its executive committee, said,\n> \"Steve shares Intuit's values. He's a straightforward, no-nonsense,\n> results-driven executive who cares deeply about people. His\n> values-oriented leadership style energizes organizations to great\n> achievement, and I look forward to working with him.\"\n>\n>\n>  -----Original Message-----\n>  From: Marino, Richard [mailto:Richard_Marino@intuit.com]\n>  Sent: Monday, April 24, 2000 8:01 PM\n>  To: Oakes, Bob; 'Janice.Farnow@avnet.com'; Velijanian, Fred\n>  Cc: Bell, Lance; Pan, Andrew\n>  Subject: High Availability Server Evaluation Results\n>\n>\n>  We first want to express our appreciation to both HP and Compaq for\n> their\n>  efforts in helping make our evaluation project a sucess.

  "text": "Hello Janice:\n\n I enjoyed your recent e-mail but was sorry to hear about your dad.  It \nsounds as though his health has deteriorated significantly.  These are always \ndifficult times.  As I watched my mother and father's health deteriorate and \nultimately watched them die, it is a very defining time in our lives.  But we \ncan be very thankful to have such great parents and to have had the privilege \nto have been raised in such loving homes.\n\n Sounds as though Eric has done very well as SMSU.  He is joining an \nexcellent company.  I am also delighted to hear that he will continue his \neducation working toward an MBA.  As we are living in an age where \nintellectual capital is so valuable, it is important for every young person \nto obtain the very best possible education they can.  As to our family, \nwithin the last ten days our youngest daughter Elizabeth was married to a \nyoung man from Buenos Aires, Argentina.  They met while they were both \nworking on a project as lawyers in Buenos Aires.  They're currently on their \nhoneymoon but shortly after returning will be moving from Buenos Aires to \nMiami, Florida.  This past Thursday night our sixth grandchild was born.  It \nwas born to our son David and his wife Courtney.  It was a 7 lb., 10 oz.,  20 \ninch little boy.  So we now have three grandsons and three granddaughters \nranging from about 2 years - 4 months down to a few days.  They are a great \ndeal of fun.  We are doing quite well.  I am looking forward to seeing Ginger \n\"Rees\" Copeland when she comes to Houston.  I would be delighted to arrange \ntickets for you and your family should you ever have occasion to visit \nHouston.\n\n I hope you have a great summer.",

This year's keynote sessio=\nn=20\nis entitled \"The E-Commerce Revolution: Innovations and  opportunity in the=\n=20\nelectronic energy marketplace\". This session has no  bullet points as I wou=\nld=20\nlike the speaker to address only the latest issues as  they see fit.

I have  attached=\n a=20\ncopy of the program for your information. There will also be a  software=20\nexhibition at the conference at which vendors will be demonstrating  their=\n=20\nproducts, as well as a post-conference seminar on data management.\n\nThis conference will be of the highly technical level that  people have com=\ne=20\nto expect from EPRM events, and I am very keen to encourage  participation=\n=20\nfrom speakers in modifying the program to suit the audience and  issues at=\n=20\nhand. If you have any suggestions or comments on the programme, please  let=\n=20\nme know; any help would be gratefully received.\n\nThis event will be thoroughly marketed through both Energy  & Power Risk=20\nManagement Magazine and our extensive database.

  "text": "Hi Liz -\n\nThe reason Ken and Linda were trying to reach you from the plane was that \nthey had some suggestions for the hotel rooms and wanted you to know their \npreference.  They would like to give the Jasmine Suite that they are \ncurrently in to the Vittors with a connecting bedroom, to take care of their \nfamily.\n\nThey would like Mark and Natalie to have the end or corner suite that the \nVittors have.\n\nKen and Linda said that they would prefer two connecting rooms, hopefully on \nthe 3rd or 4th floor.  They would like for the rooms to have the ocean view \non the North side.  If that isn't possible, it would be o.k. to overlook the \npool, but they would not really like the south side as it wouldn't be as \nquiet.  The two rooms would give them everything they need, with 2 baths.\n\nThey said they can be reached in Switzerland tomorrow.  The Hotel Meierhof's \nphone number is:  41-81-416-82-85, Fax is:  41-81-416-39-82.  They should \narrive in Davos about 9:00 a.m.\n\nI know you will have a beautiful and wonderful wedding!!  Thank you so much \nfor including me on the Save the Date list.  I feel honored!  Unfortunately, \nwe won't be able to come.   Our \"first\" anniversary is June 3, but was 1961!!\n\nTake care and call if we can do anything.\n\nRosie",

  "text": "Sarah, Cindy Olson requested that I forward this to you for further handling.\n\nRosalee\n---------------------- Forwarded by Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron on 07/10/2000 \n08:59 AM ---------------------------\n\n\nBetty Alexander@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT\n07/07/2000 06:37 PM\nTo: Jeff Skilling/Corp/Enron@ENRON\ncc: Joseph W Sutton/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Kenneth \nLay/Corp/Enron@ENRON \nSubject: OK, Jeff, you requested that we be candid about Enron...\n\n\"Management does things right; Leadership does the right things.\" (Peter \nDrucker)\n\nToday I began to wonder if I've been a fool in staunchly defending Enron's \nVisions & Values. \n\nAn esteemed colleague of very strong professional reputation at Enron was \nrecently approached by a hiring supervisor.  Totally unexpected & \nunsolicited, an offer was accepted; all seemed well as this Recruit got good \nfeedback directly from clients & Enron upper mgmt.  But after a short time, \nsuddenly Recruit was told that performance was unsatisfactory.  No specific \nbehaviors or problems were identified as cause; no opportunity given to \nmodify; Recruit was summarily removed to another floor with instructions to \nfind another job.  Upon displacement she told me (~6 weeks ago), \"I want \navoid trouble for anyone; I just want to continue quietly at Enron and forget \nthis.\"  \n\nTo date I have honored her request for silence, but all this hullabaloo about \nEnron being the best place to work makes her dilemma particularly upsetting, \nand there is ample evidence that her plight is not unique.  I refer here to \nCindy Adams, formerly of Joe Sutton's office.  I don't care why it was \ndecided not to use HR's counseling/review process designed to help when \nthings go awry; I just know that Enron's best bet is to give this talented \nprofessional more time.  She writes:\n\n...Last week, my HR Rep informed me that I have a deadline of July 15th in \nwhich to find a job...I have no assistance from HR or Recruiting.  I had 2 \ninterviews 5 weeks ago and I had to initiate those myself.  I've not received \nanswers from postings I've responded to - I am left hanging without \nacknowledgment of any sort.\n\nI have been approached and learned from others that the same thing happened \nto them with the same circumstances; one said that it took her a full 3 \nmonths to land her present job.  I am not afforded that opportunity now ...\n\nJeff, would you please ask someone to remove Cindy's July 15 deadline?  There \nare no rules left to break here; Cindy is trying to proceed diligently & \ndiscreetly, but she is under duress by not having any feedback/support from \nHR.   With a little boost, it's not too late to bring this picture into line \nwith Enron's vision of retaining topnotch people.  \n\nCindy has no idea that I'm writing on her behalf, and after this I intend to \nhonor her wishes with silence.  But you must see the irony here, not to \nmention the double standard in how Enron's Visions & Values are applied to \nassistants all over Enron:  Cindy Adams was sought after, then abruptly put \nout of the office of Joe Sutton, who happens to be our V&V expert!  I'm not \nblaming Joe for anything; he is simply the backdrop in this example.  I \nremember Joe once used an expression at a floor meeting:  \"believing your own \nbaloney.\"  He wasn't talking about Visions & Values then, but \"believing \nbaloney\" suddenly seems to fit for assistants who work at Enron.  You asked \nfor candid; herein I have done my very best to give it to you.\n\nJeff, thanks for asking and listening.  I and my colleagues are listening \ntoo, but seeing is believing.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nBetty Alexander\nSr. Administrative Assistant \n",

Enron and MDA are joining together again to do a 2nd Annual \nBeach Bowl to raise money for MDA. Last year, the event was a great success, \nraising over $70,000.  This year's goal is to raise $100,000, so the \nfundraising benchmarks for all teams have been raised. The money raised will \nbe used to further research for ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease).\n\nI have put together a team of Analyst interns (Howard Goldfarb, Rachel \nMcPhaul, Nicole Brady, Bradley Aiken and myself) for a second year to help in \nthis cause.  The benchmark for the team is the raise $600 (pre-matching), but \nI want to outdo the fundraising of $1400+ (post-matching) we did last year.\n\nI am asking for a donation to MDA to help our team bowl in this event.  \nChecks are payable to MDA.\n\nFYI, Enron matches all donations $20 or more. \n\nThe event will take place on Saturday, July 29, 2000.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\n\nThanks! Have a great day!\n\nTim Ng\nx30998\n\n",

I know you and/or your people have been\ndiscussing with Glenn Yago our so-called Emerging Domestic Markets Project.\nIt is an exciting one and we look forward to Enron's support, involvement,\nparticipation and leadership.  Glenn will be in touch as the project\nunfolds.\n\nNow I am contacting you about our upcoming Global Conference, March 8-10,\n2000 in Los Angeles.  There are two issues.\n\nFirst, I am sure you are aware, we are holding our third annual Milken\nInstitute Global Conference March 8-10, 2000 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in\nLos Angeles. A copy of the program is attached. This year's event will have\na heavy contingent of institutional investors, corporate leaders, and\ntechnology, media and policy people in the audience.  On the program, we\nhave nine Nobel Laureates, several CEOs of major corporations, and other\nheavy hitters.  As you can see, there is a major technology slant to this\nyear's program.  It will be a great event.  We would love to have some\nrepresentation from Enron in the audience.\n\nSecond, we are still accepting corporate sponsorship for the event.  I have\nattached a copy of our Sponsorship Opportunities brochure that describes the\nvarious levels ($10K - $100K), and the benefits of each sponsorship tier.\nThis is a great program to be associated with - both high-quality speakers\nand a prestigious audience.  Mike Milken and I hope to be able to count on\nyour organization for support.\n\nWe anticipate a global audience of 1,500 - senior people from the financial\nsector, business, technology, academia, the policy community and all the\nmajor media.  In just two years, our Global Conference has become a\nsignificant and influential gathering for discussion, debate and networking\non key business, economic, financial and policy questions.\n\nI hope we can count on you.\n\nRegards,\n\nDonald H.

Wondered if you have had a\nchance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken?  I know you have lots on\nyou plate.  Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go. \nBelow is the earlier email I sent to you.  Thanks for the help.  Hope all\nis well with you.\n\n\n            Nov.2 email text\n\n\nWe at Cornell's Johnson School would like to establish a stronger link\nwith Enron, a company which we believe to be a leading example of the\nagile organization which will dominate in the dynamic, unpredictable\nmarkets of the next decade.  One connecting point which we would like\nEnron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic\nOrganizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell and\nbeyond.\n\n\nThe specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two. \nFirst, we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a key\nspeaker at the Johnson School's Leadership Week in March, 2001.  As\ndescribed in the attached materials, Leadership Week is made up of three\nconferences focused on academic faculty, leading-edge corporations and\nstudents.  We very much would like Enron to present what we call a \"live\ncase study\" at the corporate conference on <underline>March 28,\n2001</underline>.\n\n\nYou, of course, are an obvious candidate to do this.  Alternatively, this\nis the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay\nand would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and\nthe Cornell community.  Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the\ncorporate conference are John Loose, President and COO of Corning, Ken\nChenault, incoming CEO of American Express, Marty Coyne, just announced\nPresident of Kodak's new Commercial Group.  Each of these leaders has a\ndistinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved in\ncontinually reinventing themselves in a fast-changing marketplace.  \n\n\nWe have several other speakers lined up for other parts of Leadership\nWeek, including Ken Blanchard and, we think, Abbey Cohen from Goldman\nSachs.  We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company\nand an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank\nRhodes, but these are still long shots.\n\n\nThe point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at the\nJohnson School and probably at Cornell next year.  If Jeff or Ken wanted\na platform for telling the Enron story, this would be a good one.  If\nthey can't do it, hopefully we could convince you to do it.  Again, the\ndate is March 28, 2001.       \n\n\nThe second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the same\nlines.  In fact, if we started working on the teaching case soon, it\ncould become the basis for the March conference live case study\npresentation.  We believe that Enron is unique in its ability to\nliterally create new markets.  The question is how do you lead and manage\nan organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in place\nthat you do, but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems to\nbe the case at Enron.  What kind of management philosophies, systems and\npractices make this possible.\n\n\nI know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in 1993 and around\n1997.  As I understand it neither focused on organizational and\nleadership issues.  We would like to devote a small research team to\nbuilding this case about Enron, directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyer\nfrom the ILR School.  We would need access to a number of people in the\nEnron organization, but are very aware of the demands on time for fast\nmoving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficient\nway.\n\n\nKevin, we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas and\nhopefully test them with your top leaders.  We will do anything we can to\nmake it feasible for Enron to engage with us on these two initiatives. \nPlease let me know what I can do to help you carry this forward.  As\nalways, thanks for your great personal support.\n\n\nDick\n\n\n\n",

First, Enr=\non=20\nbecome involved  with Enron Field for two reasons:  to keep the Astros in=\n=20\nHouston and to gain energy and facilities management business for Enron=20\nEnergy Services.  Acquiring the naming rights to the stadium came much late=\nr=20\nin our negotiations with the Astros.  In addition, while sports events like=\n=20\nNASCAR are exciting to watch and get a fair amount of media play,  we're=20\ntargeting a more specific audience with our advertising dollars.\n =20\nIncreasingly, Enron=01,s integrated products and services require the appro=\nval=20\nof an organization=01,s highest ranking officers, people who carry a =01&CX=\nO=018=20\ntitle, such as chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief=20\ninformation officer or chief technology officer. These individuals may not=\n=20\nrecognize Enron=01,s name and abilities as readily as energy-centric execut=\nives.\n\nWe also want to reach the elected and appointed officials who set policy an=\nd=20\nregulations affecting Enron businesses worldwide. The \"Ask Why\" advertising=\n=20\ncampaign launched in February this year was designed with these groups in=\n=20\nmind as well as to put the Enron name and image on everyone=01,s radar scre=\nen.=20\nEnron commercials continue to appear on business channels such as CNBC and=\n=20\nCNNfn, as well as the History Channel, ESPN and network news programs. Some=\n=20\nare running in Europe as well.\n\nWhile we won't rule out entirely the possibility of directing some of our=\n=20\nfuture advertising dollars toward sports events, for now, we believe we are=\n=20\nspending our ad budget where it will have the greatest positive impact on o=\nur=20\nbusiness.\n\nThanks for your suggestion.  Keep them coming.\n\nKen\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKelly Merritt@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT\n10/03/2000 04:20 PM\nTo: Kenneth Lay@ENRON\ncc: =20\nSubject: Advertising Campaign - NASCAR\n\nMr. Lay,\n\nI wasn't able to get my question to you at the all employee meeting. It was=\n=20\nthis:\n\nThe Enron sponsored Houston mini-cart Grand Prix entry placed second and=20\nreceived free air time of \"Enron\" on the news. With NASCAR being as popular=\n=20\nas it is today, itself a multi-billion dollar industry, why hasn't Enron=20\nsponsored a racing team to compete against the other Fortune 500 sponsors?=\n=20\nEnron is supporting stadiums, but why not a competition based on fuel,=20\nenergy, and the most powerful being the victor?\n\nNow with cigarettes and alcohol banned from advertising, companies such as=\n=20\nAOL, Compaq, Southern Company, and Infoseek are on the tracks. Each race=20\nwould provide more airtime of the Enron logo and further placement of \"The=\n=20\nNew Power Company\" in the retail consumer/viewer's venue. It would also giv=\ne=20\nme someone to \"root\" for.\n\nKelly Merritt\nAsset Mgr. - CALME/ENA\n\n",

In the letter, Roger outlines a business\nopportunity that he believes has a potential synergy with Enron.\n\nWhile I am not familiar with this business opportunity, I am very familiar\nwith Roger.  He is now semi-retired following a very successful business\ncareer.  He remains a special advisor to the chairman of Merrill Lynch &\nCo., Inc., in New York.  Previously, he was executive VP and global director\nof all debt markets underwriting, sales, and trading for the firm.\n\nSince the early 1990s, Roger has been actively involved with MU,\nspecifically with the College of Business.  He has served as chair of both\nthe Strategic Development Board and the Davenport Society.  Roger also was a\nmember of the steering committee for the college's very successful capital\ncampaign.  I hold him in the highest regard and feel fortunate that he, like\nyou, has chosen to contribute to his undergraduate alma mater in various\nsignificant ways.\n\nI hope you will consider the opportunity described in Roger's letter.  I\nknow he must think it has a great deal of potential if he decided to present\nit to you.\n\nFinally, thanks very much for your holiday card and the donation\nopportunity, which benefitted Boys & Girls Club of Columbia in my case.\nSeason's greetings,\n\nBruce Walker",

We provide you with updates of the Institute's \ncurrent research publications, events and media programs.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIN THIS WEEK'S ISSUE:\n1. Pentagon \"Shocked\" to Find Rivers Dammed with Pork\n2. The Environmental Propaganda Agency\n3. William Lloyd Garrison, Antislavery Crusader\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPENTAGON \"SHOCKED\" TO FIND RIVERS DAMMED WITH PORK\n\nCaptain Louis Renault -- Claude Raines's cheerfully duplicitous character in \nthe 1942 film classic \"Casablanca\" -- asserted glibly that he was \"shocked, \nshocked\" to learn that gambling was taking place at Rick's Cafe. Moments \nlater he was only too happy to collect his gambling earnings for the night.\n\nAll this is by way of preamble to a new Pentagon investigation of fraud in \nmilitary construction. The investigation concluded that three senior Army \nCorps of Engineers officials had, just as one whistle-blowing Corps economist \nhad claimed, engaged in a deceitful campaign to justify what the Washington \nPost called \"a billion-dollar construction binge on the Mississippi and \nIllinois rivers.\"\n\n\"The [Pentagon] investigators concluded that the agency's aggressive efforts \nto expand its budget and missions, as well as its eagerness to please its \ncorporate customers and congressional patrons, have helped 'create an \natmosphere where objectivity in its analyses was placed in jeopardy,'\" the \nPost reports.\n\n\"Even the agency's retired chief economist told them that Corps studies were \noften 'corrupt,' and that several Corps employees cited 'immense pressure' to \ngreen-light questionable projects.\"\n\nBureaucratic boondoggles of such magnitude are certainly newsworthy. But they \nare hardly news. Just as the Soviets derided the failures of previous Five \nYear Plans (only to implement new, equally flawed versions), so it seems that \nevery few years the Pentagon uncovers massive corruption and waste in its own \ncentrally planned fiefdom -- only to present a new Plan that operates under \nthe same bad incentives that encouraged prior malfeasance.\n\nWith corruption and waste seemingly \"taken care of,\" the worst pork-barrel \nspenders in Congress and the military are then let off the hook, only to \nenjoy -- like Casablanca's Renault and Rick -- an amicable toast to the \nbeginnings of a beautiful new friendship.\n\nFor the Washington Post series on the Army Corp of Engineers boondoggle, see\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-1.html.\n\nFor a summary of the Independent Institute book, ARMS, POLITICS AND THE \nECONOMY: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives, edited by Robert Higgs, see\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-2.html.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTHE ENVIRONMENTAL PROPAGANDA AGENCY\n\nWill the neck-to-neck presidential race help reduce -- or intensify -- \npressure for the next president of the United States to score points with \nstatist environmental activists?\n\nExcept on a few controversial issues, a strong case can be made that the \nforty-third President of the United States will wish to portray himself as a \nclose friend of \"the environment.\" President George W. Bush, for example, \nwould face strong pressure to show that he is \"bipartisan\" in his approach to \nenvironmental protection; whereas President Al Gore would likely attempt to \nwin back those who supported Nader and the Greens.\n\nAll the more reason, then, to call attention to the failures of the current \napproach to environmental protection -- especially those emanating from the \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or, as economist Craig Marxsen terms \nit, the Environmental Propaganda Agency.\n\nThe EPA sometimes employs the language of cost-benefit analysis to illustrate \nits seemingly tremendous success, but it is known to employ it in a highly \nmisleading manner. The EPA claimed, for example, that its Clean Air Act \nprograms produced, from 1970 to 1990, $22.2 trillion dollars in health \nbenefits at a cost of only $523 billion. But, reports Marxsen in THE \nINDEPENDENT REVIEW, \"[The EPA's] study actually represents a milestone in \nbureaucratic propaganda. Like junk science in the courtroom, the study \nseemingly attempts to obtain the largest possible benefit figure rather than \nto come as close as possible to the truth.\"\n\nIn conclusion, writes Marxsen, \"Without the illusory benefit of all the lives \nsaved, the actual benefits of the Clean Air Act were very modest and probably \ncould have been achieved nearly as well with far less sacrifice. The Clean \nAir Act and its amendments force the EPA to mandate reduction of air \npollution to levels that would have no adverse health effects on even the \nmost sensitive person in the population. The EPA relentlessly presses forward \nin its absurd quest, like a madman setting fire to his house in an insane \ndetermination to eliminate the last of the insects infesting it.\"\n\nFor more information, see \"The Environmental Propaganda Agency,\" by Craig S. \nMarxsen (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW, Summer 2000), at\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-3.html.\n\nFor analysis of other EPA programs, see the Independent Institute book, \nCUTTING GREEN TAPE: Toxic Pollutants, Environmental Regulation and the Law, \nedited by Richard Stroup and Roger Meiners, at \nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-4.html.\n\nFor Robert Formaini's insightful review of Kip Viscusi's important book, \nRATIONAL RISK POLICY (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW, Winter 1999), see\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-5.html.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON, Antislavery Crusader\n\n\"I will be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice. On this \nsubject, I do not wish to think, or speak, or write with moderation.... I \nwill not equivocate -- I will not excuse -- I will not retreat a single inch \n-- and I will be heard.\"\n     -- William Lloyd Garrison, THE LIBERATOR, January 1, 1831\n\nDecember 12 marks the 195th anniversary of the birth of William Lloyd \nGarrison, a leading figure in the American abolitionist movement. As the late \nhistorian Henry Mayer explained in his National Book Award-Finalist \nbiography, ALL ON FIRE: William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of Slavery:\n\n\"William Lloyd Garrison (1805-1879) is an authentic American hero who, with a \nBiblical prophet's power and a propagandist's skill, forced the nation to \nconfront the most crucial moral issue in its history. For thirty-five years \nhe edited and published a weekly newspaper in Boston, THE LIBERATOR, which \nremains today a sterling and unrivaled example of personal journalism in the \nservice of civic idealism.\n\n\"Although Garrison -- a self-made man with a scanty formal education -- \nconsidered himself 'a New England mechanic' and lived outside the precincts \nof the American intelligentsia, he nonetheless did the hard intellectual work \nof challenging orthodoxy, questioning public policy, and offering a luminous \nvision of a society transformed. He inspired two generations of activists -- \nfemale and male, black and white -- and together they built a social movement \nwhich, like the civil rights movement of our own day, was a collaboration of \nordinary people, stirred by injustice and committed to each other, who \nachieved a social change that conventional wisdom first condemned as wrong \nand then ridiculed as impossible.\"\n\nIndeed, without Garrison's inflammatory but compelling writing, speaking and \norganizing, there might have been no effective American anti-slavery movement \nat all.\n\nFor more on William Lloyd Garrison, read historian Henry Mayer's talk from \nthe Independent Policy Forum, \"The Civil War: Liberty and American Leviathan\" \n(with Jeffrey Rogers Hummel), at\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-6.html, or hear it in \nRealAudio at http://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-7.html.\n\nAlso see Jeffrey Rogers Hummel's review of Henry Mayer's brilliant biography, \nALL ON FIRE: William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of Slavery (THE \nINDEPENDENT REVIEW, Fall 2000), at\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-8.html.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you enjoy receiving THE LIGHTHOUSE ... please help us support it.\n\nYour supporting Independent Associate Membership enables us to reach \nthousands of other people.

  "text": "Jim:\n\nThank you for your communication advising as to the concern that the IRS\nseems to have about non-profits and the internet.  In early February of\nthis year I filed a form 1023 seeking a tax determination letter for\n\"Technology For All\" a Texas non-profit corporation whose mission it is\nto enhance the educational and economic opportunities of the\ndisadvantaged (\"TFA\").  TFA has a strong board led by Ken Lay, the CEO\nof Enron Corporation.  TFA has assisted its affiliates (all believed to\nbe tax exempt non profits) in building computer learning centers\n(\"CLC's\") where recycled computers and donated software are connected\nover the Enron Broadband Network (donated to TFA) to a server farm that\ndelivers to the disadvantaged at the CLC's educational and other\ncontent.  There are over 75 CLC's in Houston, some 25 in Colorado and we\nare building affiliations that will build them across the country and\neventually all over the world.  The business plan for this contemplates\noperations in excess of one billion by the end of five years.  However,\nwe have not yet received our tax determination letter.  We have found\nthat major contributors require a tax determination letter.\n\n    I received a response from the IRS on May 3, 2000.  On May 11, 2000,\nI responded with answers to the inquiries made by the IRS.  Then on June\n8 I was advised that our application had been sent to the national\noffice.  On November 15 I received another letter from the IRS raising\nsome additional questions unrelated to the first response.  While there\nwere some that were of substance in the main they were pretty weak.  The\nfirst question was something like \"What did we mean by disadvantaged?\"\n\n    My question to you is what do you think is best to get this going\nand out of the IRS?  Should I ask our board members to use their\nconsiderable political influence tocause the IRS to move this?  Back in\nAugust I had Bill Archer give the Commissioner an invitation to finish\nthis.  It did not seem to work.  I do not wish for an effort on my part\nto cause this to go to the bottom of some bureaucrats stack.     Your\nadvice would be appreciated.\n\nRegards:\n\nJack Clark",

  "text": "Jack:\n\n    We routinely work with applications that have been \"sent to the national\noffice.\"  If an application is \"sent to the national office,\" it means that\nan issue or issues have been identified in the application by the original\nreviewing agent that give the agent pause, and which the agent feels a more\ntechnical review by a more skilled agent is required.  It always means that\nthere is some problem with the application that could result in denial of the\napplication.\n\n    I suspect that what the IRS would really like your client to do is\nestablish objective standards in your organization's fundamental documents\nfor determining who is to receive the assistance of the charity.   Such\nstandards would give the IRS assurance that only poor people would receive\nthe benefits, and make it easier to determine if the mission was being\nadhered to in an audit of activities.  Addressing this concern could be as\nsimple as enacting a Bylaw amendment or more likely an amendment to the\nArticles of Incorporation.\n\n    Last year, our office was brought in at the \"national office\" stage, well\nafter the Form 1024 was filed, to help a group of ranchers and cattlemen in\nWyoming/Montana opposed to illegal imports of below cost beef, to obtain\ntrade association status, (501(c)(6)), that the national office kept trying\nto deny by saying they were an agriculture organization (which meant\npotentially less availability of tax deductible contributions under o162).\nWhat we did in that case was setup a conference call with the client's\nlawyers and the IRS national office team assigned to the file.  We talked\nthrough the application, identified each and every problem the IRS had\nidentified, and then our firm prepared, in essence, a supplemental brief\naddressing each issue.  In the process, we learned that a few minor changes\nto the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, plus the supplemental\napplication information, were enough to address the IRS's agents concerns,\nand they issued the tax determination letter.\n\n    Thus, I would suggest that you request a conference call with the\nnational office agent or \"team\" reviewing the application, and get them to\nidentify each and every concern with the application.   Then, ask them for a\nperiod of time to respond.  Ask them if changes in the fundamental corporate\ndocuments would help address their concerns.  And of course, be mindful that\nif you have had ongoing activities, you will want to be sure that anything\nyou do will result in retroactive deductibility for what contributions you\nhave already received.\n\n    During late 1999, the IRS was accused of responding to political pressure\nin triggering audits of exempt organizations by the Landmark Legal\nFoundation, a conservative, Washington, D.C. legal foundation.  Landmark did\na Freedom of Information Act request and released documents which tended to\nindicate that the IRS was auditing groups in response to complaints from\nCongressmen.  The IRS denied that political influence plays a role in its\ndecisions, and, since then, the IRS exempt organizations unit has been very\ncareful about not creating an impression that they respond to political\npressure.\n\n    If your client would like our firm to help as a consultant to work with\nthe national office, we'd be pleased to be of assistance.  We would need to\nreview the file and have your client execute a Form 2848 Power of Attorney\nfor us to join the team.\n\n    Hope this is helpful.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJim Lacy\nWewer & Lacy, LLP\n\nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: The information contained in this communication and\nany\naccompanying document(s) is protected by the attorney-client and/or the\nattorney/work product privileges.

  "text": "Jim:\nIt was a pleasure speaking with you on Wednesday.  Based on our conversatio=\nn,=20\nthis email includes the following:\n\nAn Enron contact to discuss developing small-scale generation on Tribal lan=\nds.\n\nOur views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on h=\now=20\nto remove those impediments.\n\nA description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWR=01,s ability=\n to=20\nsign contracts with power suppliers, and options to resolve them. Two=20\npossible options for addressing the credit issue are 1) a California PUC=20\norder clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through=20\nrates, and 2) an amendment to AB1X designed to accomplish the same goal.  I=\n=20\nhave attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and propose=\nd=20\namendments to AB1X.  We believe that an amendment to AB1X is the preferable=\n=20\noption.\n\nOur assessment of the supply/demand picture in California.\n\nOur suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near-=\n=20\nand long-term electricity crisis in California.  We will deliver to your=20\noffice today detailed legislative language.  In those materials we will als=\no=20\nidentify existing bills that we believe can easily accommodate our proposed=\n=20\nlanguage.\n\nI hope that the information is useful.  Please do not hesitate to contact m=\ne=20\nif you would like to discuss these materials further, or if there is anythi=\nng=20\nelse that I can do to assist you.\n\nRegards,\nKen Lay\n\n\n\nContact Information to Discuss Interest Expressed by Native American Tribes=\n=20\nin Installing Small-scale Generation on Tribal Lands\n\nDavid Parquet, Vice-President\nEnron North America\n101 California Street, Suite 1950\nSan Francisco, CA 94111\nPhone: 415.782.7820\nFax: 415.782.7851\n\n\n2. Key Barriers to Distributed Generation\n\nExcessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges\n\nSolution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took=\n a=20\nstep in the right direction.  Utility stand-by charges have always been=20\ndesigned by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract=20\nmonopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no reason to limit t=\nhe=20\nelimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than=20\n1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for=\n=20\nCalifornia to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc=\ne=20\nthe risk of black outs this summer.  We would propose lifting the cap by=20\noffering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development o=\nf=20\ndistributed generation.\n=20\nExcessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with=20\ninvestor-owned and municipal utilities\n\nSolution:   The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is =\na=20\nstep in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete=20\ninterconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this=\n=20\nrequirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed=20\ngeneration.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when=\n=20\ninterconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome=\n=20\nthrough executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent=20\npossible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th=\ne=20\nutility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be=20\naccomplished through amendments to SB 27X.\n\nPermitting and Air Quality Issues\nDevelopers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs=\n or=20\ngreater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an=\nd=20\ntherefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale=20\ngeneration faces. =20\n\nSolution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru=\n=20\nD-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant=\n=20\noutput apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facil=\nities.=20\nIn addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to=\n=20\nface local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial=20\ninterests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects=\n. =20\nThese objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.\n\n3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase=\n=20\nElectricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20\n\nEnron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with=\n=20\nsuppliers.\nEnron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th=\ne=20\ngoal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible.\nHowever, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk=\n=20\nconcerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.\nWe understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c=\nredit=20\nrisk concerns.\nEnron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and=\n=20\nis working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to=\n=20\nboth sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements=\n=20\ngoing forward.\n\nSummary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue\n\nAmbiguous Ratemaking Authority\nThe language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20\ncharge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our=\n=20\nanalysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20\nCalifornia PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  =\nAs=20\nsuch, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat=\nes=20\nadequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.\n\nAmbiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018\nThe language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public=\n=20\nUtilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are=\n=20\n=01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref=\nuse to=20\nallow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20\npurchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr=\nee=20\nto include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that=\n=20\nDWR has entered into with suppliers.\n=20\nAmbiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to=\n=20\nRecover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases\nIn addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority=\n=20\nnoted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to=\n=20\nthe specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl=\noy to=20\npermit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i=\ns=20\nextremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu=\nre=20\nDWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it =\nis=20\ndifficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in=\n=20\nrates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase=\n=20\ncosts.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since=\n=20\nsuppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover=\n=20\nfrom ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.\n\nOptions to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20\n\nWe have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri=\nsk=20\nissues.  We have identified three options:\n\nAmend AB1X\nThe amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the=\n=20\nPUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur=\nred by=20\nDWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary =\nto=20\nensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the=\n=20\npreferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political=\n=20\nchallenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file=20\nentitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.)\n\nClarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20\nthrough Contract Language\nThis is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20\nimplement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo=\nre=20\ntime to implement than the \"legislative\" fix.  We have attached electronic=\n=20\ncopies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC=\n=20\nwould need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled,=20\n=01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018)\n\nMake Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk\nAs indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac=\ncept=20\nother forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,=\n=20\ncash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have=\n=20\nindicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR=\n=20\nprefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through=\n=20\ncontract amendments.\n\n4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001\n\nBoth the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20\nAssociates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports=\n=20\nshowing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They diffe=\nr=20\nonly on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  Al=\nl=20\ncredible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer=\n=20\nof 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20\nlikely. =20\n\nCEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20\nsummer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our=20\nestimates.  California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,=\n well=20\nbelow the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio=\nn=20\nin the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power=\n=20\nthan other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20\nunpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t=\no=20\ndate. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t=\nhe=20\nflexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20\nCalifornia=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to =\nthis=20\nrequirement. =20\n\nOther reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early=\n=20\ndraw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve=\nre=20\nsupply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced=\n=20\nnumber of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20\nutilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren=\nt=20\npace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be=\n=20\nadded to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.\n\nCERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of=\n=20\nrolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more=20\noptimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000=\n=20\nMWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California=\n=20\nshould view the CEC's \"rosy scenario\" with considerable skepticism.\n\n5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California=\n=01,s=20\nElectricity Crisis\n\nThis email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We wil=\nl=20\ndeliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing=\n=20\nbills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.\n\nAs we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's=20\ncrisis must focus on four issues:\n\nIncrease supply\nDecrease demand\nEstablish a truly competitive retail electricity market\nReturn California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency\n\nIncrease supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)\nTo site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. =\n=20\nEnron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less=\n=20\nthan a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer.\n\nThe Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi=\nslation=20\nare steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve tho=\nse=20\nefforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face=\n=20\nin securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20\nrequirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron=01,s=\n=20\nproposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20\ntransfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an=20\ninnovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20\nemissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a=\nir=20\ndistricts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the=20\nrequired reductions in pollution emissions.\n\nDecrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)\nBecause of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing=\n=20\nthe supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the=\n=20\nbest chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished mo=\nst=20\neffectively and quickly in two ways:\n\nBuy-down demand\nCalifornia is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun=\nd=20\nto finance DWR=01,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand=\n more=20\neconomically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou=\nld=20\nbe willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,=\n=20\nthrough the summer months).

To=20\nparticipate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment=20\nnecessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the=20\nreductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&D=\neal=20\nBench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.\n\nUse Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment\nTo be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:\n\nAn internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price=\n=20\nfor hour-ahead power in real time.=20\nReal-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment=\n=20\nverification.\nSettlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be=\n=20\npaid for load reduction (=01&Negawatts=018).\n\nThe potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ=\ne:\n\n=01&creation=018 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, parti=\ncularly=20\nin the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation=\n=20\nresources.\nreduction of  peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California=20\nelectric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity =\nin=20\nthe state.\nfostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris=\nk=20\nof hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to=20\ncustomers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for=\n=20\nresponding.=20\n\nWe estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in=\n=20\nexcess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for=\n=20\nsummer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.  We further estimate=\n=20\nthat the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time=\ns=20\nthat amount.  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates=20\ndirectly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and=20\ncontrol systems that would support load curtailment implementation.\n\nEstablish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehi=\ncle:=20\nSB27X\nThe only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we=\nre=20\ncustomers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy=\n=20\nservice providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from=\n=20\ncustomers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th=\ne=20\nprohibition against Direct Access.\n\nEnron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a=\n=20\ndirect access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department o=\nf=20\nWater Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from=\n=20\ncustomer migration. =20\n\nIn addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when=\n=20\nthe utility is removed completely from the procurement function.  Procureme=\nnt=20\nis not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial=20\ncondition in which the utilities now find themselves.  California should=20\ntherefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement=20\nfunction entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a=20\nnon-utility provider within 36 months.  To execute the transition, Californ=\nia=20\nshould hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period =\nin=20\nwhich competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments=\n=20\nof utility load.\n\nReturn California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency=01*Legislative =\nvehicle:=20\nAB18X\nUtility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand=\n. =20\nIn short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California=01,s supply-demand=20\nimbalance.  In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers=\n=20\nand businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ=\nia=20\nState government assume the role of =01&electricity buyer=018 for an extend=\ned=20\nperiod of time.  Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc=\ne=20\nin California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to=20\nparticipate in that market.\n\nCalifornia can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a=\n=20\nseries of staged rate increases.  California should design those rate=20\nincreases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without=\n=20\n=01&shocking=018 the economy or household budgets For example, California c=\nould=20\namortize the recovery of the utilities=01, past debt over a 5-10 year perio=\nd. =20\nIn addition, the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways:=\n=20\nFirst, the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in=20\nrecognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of =\nAB=20\n1890.  Second, California can =01&net=018 the revenues the utilities have r=\neceived=20\nfrom selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they hav=\ne=20\naccrued due to the retail price cap.\n\n ",

If you \nare not planning to meet that deadline, please see Lilia about how you can \nget your presentation to Gene.\n\nThe first drafts were a good start.

As you make your revisions, \nkeep in mind that your objective should be to provide a succinct, but \nthorough assessment of the investment that will inform a discussion on how to \nbest add value and manage the investment going forward.\n\nIf you have not gotten my feedback and would like it, we can arrange to speak \nover the weekend.  I will be traveling, but if you leave a voice message, we \ncan arrange a time to speak.  I will be generally available by phone Saturday \nmorning through early afternoon.\n\nThanks,\nBarbara\n\n",

Most, however, read more like a pitch  \n[Paige, Barbara]  than an assessment/evaluation.  As you make your revisions, \nkeep in mind that your objective should be to provide a succinct, but \nthorough assessment of the investment that will inform a discussion on how to \nbest add value and manage the investment going forward.\n\nIf you have not gotten my feedback and would like it, we can arrange to speak \nover the weekend.

MIT Professor Rudi\nDornbusch makes the argument that the development community\nshould not confuse inequality with poverty -- even though at the\nbottom they might feel the same.\n\nComing Monday: A New Globalist Paper\nPRICING AIDS MEDICATIONS TO A HUMAN SCALE\nIn a scramble for good publicity, pharmaceutical companies have\nstarted a downward bidding war in pricing AIDS medications for\nAfrican markets. To add a much-needed measure of fairness to\nthe process, we propose a better alternative -- adjusting the price\nof treatment to per-capita GDP.\n\nBest regards from Washington,\n\nStephan Richter\nPublisher and Editor-in-Chief\nwww.TheGlobalist.com\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlso this week:\n\nJAPAN -- DON'T TRUST ANYONE OVER 55!\nDuring the course of its decade-long economic malaise, Japan\nhas tried just about every trick in the book to get its economy\ngrowing again. We may have found the answer -- but be warned,\nthose over the age of 55 may not like it!\nhttp://www.theglobalist.com/nor/gdiary/2001/03-21-01.shtml\n\nCHINA'S CARIBBEAN ISLAND HIDEAWAY\nWhy does China have an embassy on the tiny Caribbean island\nof St. Lucia -- an island 8,000 miles away from Beijing and with which\nit has few economic or political ties?\nhttp://www.theglobalist.com/nor/gdiary/2001/03-19-01.shtml\n\nComing Friday: A New Globalist Bookshelf Feature\nROBERT KAPLAN ON THE TURKEY-ISRAEL AXIS\nTurkey is in the midst of an economic crisis -- and Israel's relations\nwith the Palestinians have steadily deteriorated. So what do these\ncountries have to gain by forming a strategic alliance?\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________________________________\n\nTo unsubscribe from this service, click here:\nhttp://www.tafnet.com/TAFmailer/uns.asp?Unsub=klay@enron.com\n[Tracking ID:985284327|6188]\n\n",

As a result oil prices pushed\nslightly higher with NYMEX crude trading at $26.80 and IPEC crude trading at\n25.06. OPEC ministers have indicated that members have highlighted $25/bbl\nas a price that they feel comfortable with.The decreases per country were as\nfollows:\n\nAlgeria - 32,000\nIndonesia - 52,000\nIran - 146,000\nKuwait - 80,000\nLibya - 54,000\nNigeria - 82,000\nQatar - 26,000\nSaudi Arabia - 324,000\nUAE - 88,000\nVenezuela - 116,000\nTotal - 1,000,000\n\n\nENERGY AFRICA LOOK TOWARD THE MOROCCAN DEEP\nRabat - This week the MENA Petroleum Bulletin spoke with Andrew Windham,\nGroup General Counsel for Energy Africa. Amina Benkhadra, General Manager of\nONAREP (25%) added to the growing list of re-entrants to Morocco, signing a\npetroleum agreement with Energy Africa (63.75%) and Taurus Petroleum AB\n(11.25%). This agreement, taking effect March 1st 2001, concerned three\nexploration permits offshore Morocco collectively known as the Tiznit\nOffshore area.\nEnergy Africa Morocco Ltd (operator), together with Taurus Petroleum\n(co-partner) will implement exploration work on the three permits of the\nTiznit Offshore area covering approximately 6000sq.km. This is Energy\nAfrica's second Petroleum Agreement covering acreage offshore Morocco, the\nfirst being the Cap Draa Haute Mer area where Energy Africa holds 20% equity\nbringing the total acreage held by it in the country to 18,000sq.km.\nAndrew Windham, said, 'the country has all the characteristics offshore\nwhich make potentially, for substantial discoveries. But at this stage it is\nvery much untried and untested, so it is a very exciting place to be at the\nmoment. We are in right at the start of some new plays.'\nFor further details please see the April issue of the MENA Petroleum\nBulletin.\n\n\nREPSOL MAKE 2ND LIBYA DISCOVERY\nLondon - Repsol YPF SA said it discovered oil at a second well during\nexploration in Libya. The well in the Murzuq Basin, 800km south of Tripoli,\nproduced oil at a rate of 1,300bbl/d, the company said in a press release.\nRepsol is testing the site on behalf of a consortium including OMV,\nTotalFinaElf and Saga Petroleum. Repsol began searching for oil in the area\nin May 1998, when the Libyan government granted approval for exploration and\nproduction sharing arrangements with foreign companies. The companies\ncurrently produce more than 160,000bbl/d from the Murzuq Basin, said the\ncompany.\n\n\nAHMED ABDELKARIM CONFIRMED AS NEW HEAD OF NOC\nTripoli - Further to reports this week from Libya Ahmed Abdel-Karim Ahmed\nhas been formally appointed as Chairman of NOC, following reports that he\nhad been removed from the position. Representing Libya at the OPEC\nconference in Geneva it was confirmed that Al-Badri has been appointed as\nDeputy Prime Minister for Social Security. The news will comfort foreign\ninvestors who feared that further upheaval would hinder an already slow\nratification process, with approvals outstanding for three packages of\nblocks offered by NOC in late 2000.\n\n\n\n*******SPECIAL FEATURES FOR 2001******\n\nThe MENA Petroleum Bulletin is to initiate rankings and league tables for\nthe top suppliers to the oil and gas sector.

Pursuant to those\nmeetings, Mr. DeLay's office has asked for some follow-up meetings to be\nheld in Houston on Friday, April 6th.   He intends to travel to this area on\nthat day along with, and as host to, Congressman Barton (R-Texas, Chairman\nof the Energy and Power Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and\nCommerce) and with Congressman Billy Tauzin (R-Louisiana, Chairman, House\nCommittee on Energy and Commerce).    The Energy and Commerce Committee has\noversight over Clean Air Act matters.  DeLay has requested support from and\ninteraction with the BCCA and the Partnership on that day.\n\nAPRIL 6TH ACTIVITY  After time spent early in the day in Mr. DeLay's\ncongressional district to meet with Brazoria and Fort Bend County local\nofficials, Mr. DeLay has asked us to then pick up the itinerary with a ship\nchannel tour and presentations on SIP status, science and modeling issues.\nWe are working closely with Mr. DeLay's staff on all these matters.\n\nHe has asked to end the day with a \"small dinner with CEOs\" to have a frank\ndiscussion about our clean air issues.  This is the dinner my staff called\nyour office about on Friday.  Clearly, Mr. DeLay is interested in what he\nand the other congressmen may be able to due legislatively to assist in\naddressing some of the issues we have with the SIP.   He has asked that we\nalso invite Governor Perry to attend the dinner, which we are doing.  Mr.\nDeLay will call the Governor to encourage his attendance.  This will\nobviously be a critical opportunity to relay targeted information and advise\non strategy with key members of Congress and the Governor.  Everyone in\nattendance at the dinner will be provided coordinated talking points in\nadvance.  There may also be a formal briefing arranged immediately before or\nafter the April 3 Partnership Board meeting so we can prep in advance.\n\nRSVPs TO DATE  Responses so far indicate that Steve Miller, Ed Galante, Jim\nEdmonds and Jim Kollaer are confirmed to attend the dinner.  Charles Duncan\nand Kelly Frels are checking calendars.  Ken Lay, Steve Letbetter and Dan\nSmith are unavailable.  We do not have a commitment yet from the Governor.\nWe will likely recruit two or three other CEOs from BCCA member companies to\nattend the dinner.\n\nMy current thought is to house the members of Congress at the St. Regis and\nto arrange the dinner either at the River Oaks Country Club or possibly at a\nboard member's home nearby.\n\nI trust this additional information is useful to you.  I will be the\nPartnership point person on this -- please do not hesitate to call me with\nany questions you may have.  Thank you.\n\nAnne Culver\nSr. VP, Government Relations\nGreater Houston Partnership\n713/844-3624 (ph)\n713/844-0224 (fax)\naculver@houston.org\n\nVisit our website at www.houston.org\n\n\n",

The report finds that energy efficiency for buildings,\ntransportation, and industry could account for more than half of the\npotential greenhouse gas reductions achievable by 2020. Natural gas\ntechnologies, more efficient power plant technologies, and combined heat an=\nd\npower play an important role in reducing fossil energy power plant\nemissions. And \"low-carbon energy systems,\" such as renewable energy, can\nalso make an important contribution. Perhaps equally important is the\nfinding that there is \"no single path to a low emission future.\"\n\nRead more:\nwww.unep.ch/ipcc/ <http://www.unep.ch/ipcc/>\n\n--------------------------------\n\nBarriers to Energy Efficiency In Public, Private Organizations\n\nThere is a gap between the opportunities for cost-effective energy-\nefficiency investment identified in energy models and the levels actually\nseen in practice, according to SPRU, a science and technology policy\nresearch group in England. The origins of the gap are claimed to lie in a\nseries of barriers, such as lack of capital, lack of information or hidden\ncosts, which prevent markets for energy and energy-using technologies from\noperating efficiently.  SPRU says that understanding the size and nature of\nthis gap is essential if policies to mitigate climate change through\nimproved energy efficiency are to be successful. These policies must succee=\nd\nin the context of liberalizing energy markets and increasing interest in th=\ne\ndevelopment of a broadly based energy service industry.\n\nRead more:\nwww.sussex.ac.uk/spru/environment/research/barriers.html\n<http://www.sussex.ac.uk/spru/environment/research/barriers.html>\n\n--------------------------------\n\nState of the World Report\n\nFrom the thinning of the Arctic sea ice to the invasion of the\nmosquito-borne West Nile virus, the Worldwatch Institute's State of the\nWorld 2001 shows how the economic boom of the last decade has damaged\nnatural systems.

This area accounts for almost 50,000 housing starts a year, more\nthan are built in 42 states.  One of the main reasons for adopting the code\nis the area's commitment to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as part of the\nTexas state plan for controlling smog.  Since the IECC contains a new\nstandard for reducing window solar heat gain, which reduces air conditionin=\ng\nenergy use substantially, it cuts NOx emissions from the power plants that\nserve the air conditioning load.  The Alliance supported Public Citizen, th=\ne\nTexas Building Energy Institute, the Sustainable Living Alliance, NCTCOG\nstaff, and others in this effort, working with the Building Codes Assistanc=\ne\nProject and Alliance Associates.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nAlliance Associates Honored with Awards\n\nMany Alliance Associates were honored at the 2001 Energy Star Awards\nCeremony, hosted by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the\nDepartment of Energy.

(NASDAQ: INTU\n> <http://www.quicken.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=INTU>) announced today\n> that its board of directors has selected Stephen M. Bennett as president\n> and chief executive officer. Bennett assumes his responsibilities\n> immediately, succeeding Bill Campbell, who had been acting chief executive\n> since September. Campbell is retiring from day-to-day responsibilities but\n> will remain chairman of the board of directors. Bennett was also named to\n> the board.\n> Bennett, 45, was most recently an executive vice president and member of\n> the Office of the CEO at GE Capital, the financial services subsidiary of\n> General Electric Corp. GE Capital is the world leader in numerous\n> financial industries, including private label credit cards, commercial\n> equipment leasing and vendor finance. With $330 billion in assets, GE\n> Capital provides 42% of General Electric's overall profits and is among\n> the world's largest non-banking financial institutions.\n> \"Steve is an outstanding leader from a company renowned for strong\n> leadership,\" said Campbell. \"His experience is tailor-made to fit Intuit's\n> needs now and in the future. We wanted someone with service industry\n> knowledge, who had led large, complex organizations and with proven\n> ability to produce fast growth. Steve is the ideal choice to take Intuit\n> to the multi-billion dollar level.\"\n> \"Intuit is the leader in e-finance. Quicken.com is already the leader in\n> online tax preparation and online mortgage origination,\" said Bennett, who\n> will relocate from Connecticut to the Bay Area. \"I'm excited to have the\n> opportunity to continue developing services for the Internet and take\n> Intuit's industry leadership to new heights.\"\n> During his GE career, Bennett held significant leadership positions in six\n> different businesses within the company, spanning both manufacturing and\n> financial services. In his most recent position, he oversaw a portfolio of\n> five different companies whose more than 20,000 employees last year\n> generated $15 billion in annual volume. Prior to that, as president and\n> CEO of GE Capital e-Business, he pioneered the company's efforts to\n> leverage the Internet across GE Capital's worldwide portfolio of\n> businesses.\n> Previously he delivered significant growth as the president and CEO of GE\n> Capital's more than 4,000-employee Vendor Financial Services business.\n> Under his leadership, assets grew to more than $13 billion from $5 billion\n> and net income increased to $200 million from $80 million in four years.\n> Intuit board member John Doerr said he was impressed by Bennett's broad\n> base of experience. \"Steve knows business-to-business as well as\n> business-to-consumer. He knows service businesses. And he gets the Net.\n> Intuit's product leadership and Steve's ability to grow businesses are an\n> ideal match for our future.\"\n> Bennett added, \"Intuit's management team is strong, stable and experienced\n> and works well together,\" he said. \"This is one of the few management\n> teams to successfully and rapidly transform a company to the Net. I'm glad\n> to have the opportunity to lead Intuit's continued growth and expansion.\"\n> Scott Cook, Intuit founder and chairman of its executive committee, said,\n> \"Steve shares Intuit's values. He's a straightforward, no-nonsense,\n> results-driven executive who cares deeply about people. His\n> values-oriented leadership style energizes organizations to great\n> achievement, and I look forward to working with him.\"\n>\n>\n>  -----Original Message-----\n>  From: Marino, Richard [mailto:Richard_Marino@intuit.com]\n>  Sent: Monday, April 24, 2000 8:01 PM\n>  To: Oakes, Bob; 'Janice.Farnow@avnet.com'; Velijanian, Fred\n>  Cc: Bell, Lance; Pan, Andrew\n>  Subject: High Availability Server Evaluation Results\n>\n>\n>  We first want to express our appreciation to both HP and Compaq for\n> their\n>  efforts in helping make our evaluation project a sucess.

Pursuant to those\nmeetings, Mr. DeLay's office has asked for some follow-up meetings to be\nheld in Houston on Friday, April 6th.   He intends to travel to this area\non\nthat day along with, and as host to, Congressman Barton (R-Texas, Chairman\nof the Energy and Power Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and\nCommerce) and with Congressman Billy Tauzin (R-Louisiana, Chairman, House\nCommittee on Energy and Commerce).    The Energy and Commerce Committee has\noversight over Clean Air Act matters.  DeLay has requested support from and\ninteraction with the BCCA and the Partnership on that day.\n\nAPRIL 6TH ACTIVITY  After time spent early in the day in Mr. DeLay's\ncongressional district to meet with Brazoria and Fort Bend County local\nofficials, Mr. DeLay has asked us to then pick up the itinerary with a ship\nchannel tour and presentations on SIP status, science and modeling issues.\nWe are working closely with Mr. DeLay's staff on all these matters.\n\nHe has asked to end the day with a \"small dinner with CEOs\" to have a frank\ndiscussion about our clean air issues.  This is the dinner my staff called\nyour office about on Friday.  Clearly, Mr. DeLay is interested in what he\nand the other congressmen may be able to due legislatively to assist in\naddressing some of the issues we have with the SIP.   He has asked that we\nalso invite Governor Perry to attend the dinner, which we are doing.  Mr.\nDeLay will call the Governor to encourage his attendance.  This will\nobviously be a critical opportunity to relay targeted information and\nadvise\non strategy with key members of Congress and the Governor.  Everyone in\nattendance at the dinner will be provided coordinated talking points in\nadvance.  There may also be a formal briefing arranged immediately before\nor\nafter the April 3 Partnership Board meeting so we can prep in advance.\n\nRSVPs TO DATE  Responses so far indicate that Steve Miller, Ed Galante, Jim\nEdmonds and Jim Kollaer are confirmed to attend the dinner.  Charles Duncan\nand Kelly Frels are checking calendars.  Ken Lay, Steve Letbetter and Dan\nSmith are unavailable.  We do not have a commitment yet from the Governor.\nWe will likely recruit two or three other CEOs from BCCA member companies\nto\nattend the dinner.\n\nMy current thought is to house the members of Congress at the St. Regis and\nto arrange the dinner either at the River Oaks Country Club or possibly at\na\nboard member's home nearby.\n\nI trust this additional information is useful to you.  I will be the\nPartnership point person on this -- please do not hesitate to call me with\nany questions you may have.  Thank you.\n\nAnne Culver\nSr. VP, Government Relations\nGreater Houston Partnership\n713/844-3624 (ph)\n713/844-0224 (fax)\naculver@houston.org\n\nVisit our website at www.houston.org\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Juno is very interested in  working \nwith (and in advanced-stage discussions with) companies in the energy  \nindustry and working with them on strategic telecommunications and marketing  \npartnerships.\n?\nInformation about Juno is available at \"About Juno\" on Juno's Web site \nhttp://www.juno.com.?

Total net loss for 2001  was \nprojected to be $10-$25MM, as the company focuses on billable services,  \ncontinues to reduce expenses, and looks to develop advertising and other  \nancillary revenue streams.? The company is confident that it can meet  \nor?beat the loss target and made explicit statements that on-hand cash  \nresources are \"more than adequate\" to get the business profitable.? The  \ncompany has not publicly given a time-line for profitability to maintain  \nflexibility.  \nThe company controls one of the largest dialup subscriber audiences (4MM  \nactive subscribers as of 4Q00, 850K of whom are billable) on the Internet  \ntoday and is the 4th largest US ISP (after AOL, ELNK, and MSN).  \n2000 revenue came in at $114MM, 65% of which was derived from subscription  \nfees and 35% from advertising.? 2001 revenues are expected to come in  \nbetween $100MM-$120MM, with the revenue mix moving toward 80% subscription \nand  20% advertising due to increased focus on billable services and the \nsoft  Internet advertising markets.  \nJuno has announced broadband agreements for its Juno Express product  \ncovering all mainstream broadband transport platforms -- AT&T Broadband,  \nTime Warner Cable, and Comcast (cable); Covad (DSL); Hughes (satellite); and  \nMetricom (wireless).  \nThe company has announced wireless distribution agreements for it's Juno  \nMobile product with Palm and Sprint PCS.? Other agreements are likely to  be \nforthcoming.  \nThe company has powerful propietary technology assets that give it a  \ncompetitive advantage.? The company has launched (internally but not  \npublicly) a new business unit -- Juno Solutions -- to investigate the  \nopportunity to license these technology assets to third parties both  \ndomestically and internationally.?  \nThe Juno Virtual Supercomputer Project represents another example of  Juno's \nefforts to develop ancillary revenue streams.? This distributed  computing \ninitiative aims to leverage unused computer processing power from  Juno's MMs \nof subscribers, aggregating it for sale to biotech, pharmaceutical,  and \ncomputational chemistry firms.? \nhttp://www.juno.com/corp/news/supercomputer.html\n\n\n=============\nToby  Bryce\n(347) 200-0882\nbryce@juno.com\n=============\n?\nOn Wed, 14 Mar 2001 16:52:52 -0500 Toby Bryce <bryce@juno.com> writes:\n> Mr.  Lay,\n> \n> I am contacting you (per instructions of Rosalee) with a  director \n> opportunity with a NASDAQ-listed Internet media firm.?

Tim Koller and I hope\nit reflects all the changes suggested on the last conference call.  Of\ncourse, we will never be able to satisfy everyone to the last detail, but I\nthink we came as close as we will get.\n\n  There is still some proof reading and minor editing to do,\nand we are working on that even as we send this off.\n\n  To the best of my knowledge there may now be two \"individual\nviews\"  to go into what is now Attachment D.  Len Baker may feel that the\nlanguage on Safe Harbor doesn't go far enough.  Baruch Lev feels that the\nSEC should not only issue a \"concept release\" to solicit broad public\ncomments on a \"supplementary framework for reporting intangibles,\" but it\nshould create a task force to do the work.  (Most of the group feels this\napproach is too close to asking the SEC to mandate change.)

My suggestion, Len and Baruch, is to\nwrite a paragraph or two for Attachment D, if you wish.

  "text": "Hi Dr. Pershing -\n\nWill you please verify the dates again with me?  Is the 3:00 p.m. panel on \nMonday or Tuesday?\n\nThanks.\n\nRosalee\n\n\n\n\n\"PERSHING Jonathan, IEA/LTO\" <Jonathan.PERSHING@iea.org> on 04/24/2001 \n11:08:56 AM\nTo: \"'Kenneth.Lay@enron.com'\" <Kenneth.Lay@enron.com>\ncc:  \nSubject: RE: for Rosalee - re Mr. Lay's participation at IEA ministerial\n\n\nDear Rosalee,\n\n I would again like to thank Mr Lay for agreeing to take part in both\nour IEA ministerial session and in the OECD Forum 2001 - Sustainable\nDevelopment and the New Economy.  As discussed, he is to chair the first of\ntwo energy panels at the FORUM; his is titled \"Fuelling Sustainable\nDevelopment\".  On his panel will be Mr Kurt Yeager of EPRI (speaking on\nhydrocarbon issues), Mr Luis Echavarri, the head of the OECD's Nuclear\nEnergy Agency (speaking on nuclear power), and Danish Minister of Energy and\nEnvironment, Svend Auken (speaking on renewables and energy efficiency).\nThe panel is scheduled to take place starting at 3pm at the Cit, des\nSciences et de l'Industrie, in La Villete, in northern Paris.\n\nAs I believe I noted in our previous e-mail communications, while the IEA is\nresponsible for organising our ministerial session and the substantive\nissues related to the energy panels on the FORUM, the OECD is doing the\nFORUM logistics.  They have therefore asked that I forward to all speakers\nthe following note (see below). It asks that Mr Lay provide a number of\nlogistical inputs, including a biography and photo, as well as information\non any remarks he might choose to make. I note that as the chair of the\nfirst energy panel, he may not wish to make a formal presentation -- but\ntime does permit this if he wishes, and the decision is at his discretion.\nI would appreciate being a cc on any material you send to the OECD so we can\nkeep our files current.\n\nOn our own side, the IEA concluded its Governing Board Meeting last Friday,\nand finally approved the ministerial session agenda and arrangements.  While\nMr Priddle will be sending out a formal invitation and set of background\ndocuments to Mr Lay this week, I wanted to give you a heads up and find out\nif you had any \"last-minute\" questions which I might help answer.\n\nIn addition, I note that your last e-mail indicated Mrs Lay will be in Paris\nduring our session.  Some of our ministerial representatives are also\nplanning to bring spouses (in particular US Energy Secretary Abraham, who is\ncoming with his wife) -- do you think Mrs Lay might wish to participate in\nany events during this period with any of these others?  If you let us know,\nwe would be happy to make arrangements.\n\nAlso, please let us know if others will be travelling with Mr Lay, and if we\nmight facilitate their logistics.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nJonathan Pershing\n\n________________________\nJonathan C.

Unfortunately, the process was slowed when our primary contact at \nSmith Graham, Gabriel Hayes, left the firm earlier this year.  We have since \nreestablished discussions and the Global Finance Group is preparing a \nproposal that a portion (about $30 million) of the Enron Cash Balance Plan \nportfolio be dedicated to an emerging managers portfolio.  One-third of this \nmoney ($10 million) would be invested in bonds, which could be placed with \nSmith Graham, as the fixed-income manager .  (Total Plan assets are about \n$235 million.)\n\nThe proposal will be submitted to the Plan Administrative Committee at its \nquarterly meeting on May 3rd.  The proposal should be well received as the \nCommittiee has previously requested that  we optimize our existing allocation \nto minority money managers.  Gerald Smith has been advised that Enron is \nlooking at ways to allocate money to the firm, and that a decision should be \nreached sometime in May.  We have not communicated the specific details of \nour intentions as of yet pending the outcome of the May 3rd meeting.\n\nI am available for further discussion at your convenience.\n\nRegards,\nTim DeSpain\n(x31770)\n\n",

As you probably know, the State of Maharastra has been slow \npaying and no paying for the electricity from our plant at Dabohl for \nsometime and more recently both the State of Maharastra  and the Government \nof India have refused to honor their government guarantees on this project.  \nWe have filed a political force majeure on the project and indeed will be \nmoving into arbitration on that and a number of other issues in London in the \nnot too distant future.  Again, I believe this will send a very negative \nsignal to the market place as to the advisability of international companies \ninvesting in India.  I would think you might want to build one panel around \nthis subject.  \n\n If there's any way we can be of help, let me know.\n\nBest regards,\n\nKen Lay\n\n\n\n\n\"Colette Mathur, Director\" <indiasummit@weforum.org> on 04/24/2001 09:44:29 AM\nTo: \"klay@enron.com\" <klay@enron.com>\ncc:  \nSubject: India Economic Summit 2001, New Delhi 2-4 December\n\n\nTo the attention of:\nDr Kenneth L. Lay\nChairman\nEnron\n\n\nDear Dr Lay,\n\nWhen the Minister of Finance of India Yashwant Sinha recently presented the\n2001-2002 national budget, it was widely acknowledged as a very ambitious\n\"dream budget\" which puts India on a high growth trajectory. Most key\nsectors should benefit from these reforms, which will thus give a new boost\nto the country's economic and social progress. As such, the budget was\nwelcomed with great enthusiasm by the Indian and international business\ncommunity.\n\nOn the occasion of our India Economic Summit 2001 to be held in partnership\nwith the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) from 2 to 4 December in New\nDelhi, it will be the perfect time to assess the progress of the bold and\nextensive measures proposed in the recent budget, how they have been\nimplemented and how they have impacted the business environment, domestic\nindustry activity and foreign investment.\n\nAs we will soon be preparing the preliminary programme of the Summit, I\nwould like to take the opportunity to benefit from your expertise and\nunderstanding of the country. I would greatly appreciate receiving from you\nany particular topics or issues that you wish to see given priority on the\nagenda. Any suggestions of relevant speakers or experts that you may have\nwould also be welcomed.\n\nI look forward to receiving your response at the above e-mail address and\nkindly ask you to copy my colleague Mitra Khoubrou (e-mail:\nmitra.khoubrou@weforum.org).\n\nFor more information on the 2001-2002 Union Budget, please visit the\nwebsite of the Ministry of Finance of India at http://finmin.nic.in/fub.htm\n\nI look forward to hearing from you and hope that you will be with us in\nIndia again next December.\n\nBest regards,\n\nColette Mathur,\nDirector,\nCenter for Regional Strategies\nWorld Economic Forum\n\n\n",

  "text": "Good morning, Mike.  What time is the meeting?\n\nRosie\n\n\nTo: Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron@ENRON\ncc:  \nSubject: EGM - all company meeting\n\nKen,\n\nPer my voicemail, we are having an all employee meeting on next Monday at the \nHyatt Regency.  The purpose of this meeting is to pull everyone together for \nan update on EGM and a brief presentation from all the business units within \nEGM.  This includes about 1 hour of business and then drinks and food - we \nexpect about 500 people.  \n\nWe have made a lot of progress on changing the nature and profitability of \nthese businesses and we want to make sure everyone sees just how far we have \ncome in a few months.  \n\nI believe they will be motivated to see the growth and profitability.  We had \na record Q1 with $100 million of gross margin.  That was 50% of what they \nmade in all of 2000.  Combined with the fact that in December of 2000 alone \nwe made $87 million in gross margin, I believe it will have a big impact.\n\nIf you could attend the meeting even for a few minutes it would go a long way \nin helping us drive our other point which is that the EGM businesses are now \ncore to Enron and has the attention of both you and Jeff.\n\nThanks for considering this and let me know if you need any other information \nor assistance.\n\nMike \n\n",

(Representatives of Enron Europe will \nparticipate in the morning session by video conference, and others from \nvarious locations will participate by telephone.)\n\nThe objectives of the session are to:\n\n1) provide Enron commercial and support groups with the latest information on \nemissions regulation, markets, and Enron's advocacy efforts worldwide, and\n\n2) receive feedback on commercial interests and input on policy options so \nthat we may develop the best business and policy strategies for Enron in both \nthe short and long term.\n\nWe would like you to invite you to join the session for as long as your \nschedule permits, as well as make a few brief remarks about the importance of \nglobal emissions issues -- such as climate change and U.S. multipollutant \nlegislation -- to the group.\n\nWe are still preparing a detailed agenda, but expect to cover a number of \ntopics related to U.S. and international emissions issues.

The lawsuit has been filed by a Plaintiff who is represented\nby one of the law firms which has filed suit against i2 in the class action\nlawsuit (i.e. the Nike situation).  The Plaintiff in this lawsuit is a\nnominal shareholder and acts as a front for the Plaintiff law firm.\n\nWhat makes the lawsuit different from the class action is that it is a\nshareholder derivative lawsuit.  What this means is that the plaintiff\nshareholder has filed the lawsuit against each of you to collect damages on\nbehalf of i2.  The claim is based on the Nike facts, but the Plaintiff is\nclaiming i2 has been damaged by your actions.   What is interesting is that\nall damages recovered would go to i2.  So why the lawsuit?  The Plaintiff\ncan recover for all legal fees he incurs in bringing the lawsuit.\nDerivative actions commonly follow class action filings, as a sort of\n\"tag-along\" type of action.\n\nThe Plaintiff attorney has requested that i2 accept service of the lawsuit\non your behalf.  Normally, I would say no and let the Plaintiff law firm\ntry and track you down, but they may try and serve you at an inappropriate\ntime, i.e. client meeting, during a speech.  Please let me know if you\nwould like for us to accept service on your behalf.  This is very common\npractice.\n\nI will send each of you a copy of the lawsuit.  Needless to say, you are\nindemnified for this, i2 will pay for all legal fees incurred to defend you\nand i2 does have insurance to cover this matter.\n\nPlease let me know of your decision to have i2 accept service on your\nbehalf.\n\nThanks\n\n\nBob Donohoo\nCorporate Counsel\ni2 Technologies, Inc.\n\nThis message and the documents attached to it, if any, is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee and may contain information that may be PRIVILEGED\nand CONFIDENTIAL, and/or may contain ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT.

This summer, the United States Olympic Committee\n(USOC) will conduct initial site visits and evaluations of the eight U.S.\nbid cities with the goal being to cut the number of cities to three or four.\nThis cut will occur in December of this year.  The USOC will be conducting\nHouston's site visit July 16-19, 2001.\n\nThis site visit is critical to our ultimate success in bringing the Olympic\nGames to Houston.  Over the four-day period in which the USOC site\nevaluation team is in Houston, two days will be devoted to venue tours and\npresentations.  There are eight presentation topics predetermined by the\nUSOC, one of which is International Strategy. Simply stated, this is where\nwe show why we think Houston can win on the international level.\n\nAs a Port Commissioner and a board member of Houston 2012, I will be part of\nthe team that presents this section to the USOC site evaluation team.  As\narguably the most identifiable international corporate leader in Houston and\nas the Chairman of the 1990 Economic Summit and the 1992 Republican National\nConvention, both of which you left with a positive surplus (very important\nto the Olympics), you are in an excellent position to discuss Houston's\ninternational status.\n\nGeorge DeMontrond, Susan Bandy (the Houston 2012 Exec Director) and I would\nvery much appreciate 15 minutes or so of your time to update you on\nHouston's bid efforts and discuss your potential participation in the\nupcoming site visit. You are our first and only choice, and I'd like the\nopportunity to show you how important this is for Houston. We expect the\nnumber of U.S. bid cities to be reduced to four finalists by this December\nas a result of these meetings.  I will call Rosalee to schedule a time for a\nvisit at your offices. All the best and I look forward to catching up with\nyou soon. I'm attaching my bio, which details the last few years of activity\nI've been involved with, most of which emanated from your support for me on\nthe UH Board of Regents, the 1990 Economic Summit Host Committee, the 1992\nRNC Convention and later the GHP.

  "text": "Dear Family and Friends,\nKen and I just cut short our Italy trip with friends to return to Houston\nfor the birth of our 6th grandchild (which is the final one for this round\nof four pregnancies).  We were happy to return home and I am a very thankful\nand thrilled grandmother (aka Momie, Mamamia, Mamia, Mia).  This was the\nfirst live birth that I have personally witnessed since my last baby, Beau,\nand it was VERY exhilarating and VERY emotional, as evidenced by the\nattached photos.  I hope you will enjoy seeing my new grandson \"Pate David\nHerrold\" (Pate was Courtney's maiden name) who was born on June 8, 2000 at\n7:19 p.m.  Pate was 7 lbs, 10 ozs, 20 inches long with a lot of dark curly\nhair.  I think he looks exactly like David at birth, but time will tell.\nThese photos were taken in the delivery room within the first 15-20 minutes\nof his birth prior to being cleaned up and returned to the nursery.  He\nlooks pretty darn good for just having arrived into this world with such\ngreat force.  So far, he is a VERY calm and good infant just like his Daddy\nwas.  Enjoy!

As I watched my mother and father's health deteriorate and \nultimately watched them die, it is a very defining time in our lives.  But we \ncan be very thankful to have such great parents and to have had the privilege \nto have been raised in such loving homes.\n\n Sounds as though Eric has done very well as SMSU.  He is joining an \nexcellent company.  I am also delighted to hear that he will continue his \neducation working toward an MBA.  As we are living in an age where \nintellectual capital is so valuable, it is important for every young person \nto obtain the very best possible education they can.  As to our family, \nwithin the last ten days our youngest daughter Elizabeth was married to a \nyoung man from Buenos Aires, Argentina.  They met while they were both \nworking on a project as lawyers in Buenos Aires.  They're currently on their \nhoneymoon but shortly after returning will be moving from Buenos Aires to \nMiami, Florida.  This past Thursday night our sixth grandchild was born.  It \nwas born to our son David and his wife Courtney.  It was a 7 lb., 10 oz.,  20 \ninch little boy.  So we now have three grandsons and three granddaughters \nranging from about 2 years - 4 months down to a few days.  They are a great \ndeal of fun.  We are doing quite well.  I am looking forward to seeing Ginger \n\"Rees\" Copeland when she comes to Houston.  I would be delighted to arrange \ntickets for you and your family should you ever have occasion to visit \nHouston.\n\n I hope you have a great summer.",

It is so timely and\ncertainly fits with Kirbyjon's challenge. I have spoken with Hardie (who\nalso edited this letter for me) and we both agree that this would have much\ngreater impact if it came directly from you, as a past Father of the Year.\nAs you can see we attributed the information about our shortfall directly\nto me, so I am involved in the letter but not doing the solicitation.  If\nyou are not comfortable with this, just let me know and I will redo the\nletter.  I think if you agree to send this out over your signature it would\nbe enormously helpful.  Please let me know what you'd like me to do.\n\n  Thank you again for your thoughtfulness and continuous support.\n\n    Donna\n - KLay2000request.doc\n\n",

  "text": "Per our meeting today, I spoke with Sherrie about  lines of credit at \n(PaineWebber) PW.? We have about another $5 million  available with a little \nbit of cushion.? I also spoke with Rocky about how  they arrive at their loan \nto value calculations and he is going to have me talk  with the person in \nthat department to walk me through it.? Regardless of  how much that number \nmoves, I told Sherrie that you would like to know where it  stands at the \ntime she provides the information for all of the other  lines.? I told her \nthat we should have that updated once a  week.\n?\nI also?thought it would be good?within  the?partnership to borrow against the \nPW accounts, which include Fayez,  Cypress, Eagle, and Harris Bretall for \nsome of these private investments.?  The combined gross value is at $2.5 \nmillion so that would allow for an  additional $1.25 million to be borrowed \nat 50% loan to value.? It may be a  higher number, but with a small cushion \nthat is probably a good estimate.?  I talked to Rocky about this and he said \nit would be no problem and he would  give us the same rate 70 basis points.\n?\nWith regards to rates and the PW/UBS merger, Rocky  said that he thinks that \nhe can get our borrowing rate down from 70 basis points  plus LIBOR to 20 \nbasis points plus LIBOR come this November when the merger is  completed.\n?\nI have Rocky working on much better reports, like  that which was provided to \nbe by Mueller/O'Shaughnessy at MSDW.? I told him  that they needed to work on \nwhat they have?been providing to me.? I  have not been impressed with the \nlast couple of reports he has produced so that  is why you haven't seen \nthem.? Rocky informed me that?he has sense  gone out and purchased a better \nsystem for that purpose.\n?\nI also told him that I would like an update on the  performance reports that \nare run on managers, specifically ours.?  Also,?I am having him include \nmanagers that invest in Latin America.?  I though it would be good, since \nRobert Day of TCW has been positive about  that?geographic area.\n?\nWith regards to any future selling of personal  Enron stock, Rocky recommends \nselling within your?retirment plan since the  taxes are deferred and \ndiversify within it.? Maybe set-up some of the  managed accounts here.? I \ninquired about the Enron 401(k) plan?with  regards to any additional choices \nto be offered.? He said that he?was  in talks with the people at Enron who \nhandle it, but nothing would probably  happen anytime soon.? I don't know if \nthat meant he was implying a need for  a push from?Enron's upper management?\nto  make it happen.\n?\nI know that Sherrie is working her tail off to try  and get you the July \nFinancials before your trip.? I know she is planning  on staying late to get \nit completed.? I told her that you want them before  you depart on your trip \ntomorrow.\n?\nI think that that is all for now.\n?\n- Beau",

I am still immensely \ngrateful.  It has been a fabulous experience.  Now, Azurix is releasing me;  \nmy last day is 31 DEC 2000.  I'm looking for a new position at Enron.  \nBarring that, I take a standard severance package on 01 JAN 2001 and go \noverboard.  I'm taking the typical aggressive Enron approach to networking, \nso if you are aware of something, I'd appreciate knowing.  I'll be over to \nsee Stan Horton this afternoon at 16:00.  \n\nI've continued to hone my skills, and provide leadership and creativity in \ndifficult circumstances.  \nI know Enron is changing.  I'm willing to change (and learn!) with it.  \nThere's a lot I can do for Enron.  I'd just like to have a shot at it.  \n\nHope the holidays are joyous and safe for you and Linda and your entire \nfamily.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJ. Paul\n6-8304",

Building on the=\n=20\nsuccess of that event, I would like to invite you to make the  keynote=20\naddress at Energy & Power Risk Management  Conferences=01, third annual=20\ninformation technology event as  outlined above. This year's keynote sessio=\nn=20\nis entitled \"The E-Commerce Revolution: Innovations and  opportunity in the=\n=20\nelectronic energy marketplace\". This session has no  bullet points as I wou=\nld=20\nlike the speaker to address only the latest issues as  they see fit. My=20\nresearch has showed that the industry is very interested in  your opinions =\non=20\nthis subject and I hope you can fit this hour-long session into  you busy=\n=20\nschedule.\n\n=01+Information Technology=01, will take a focused look  at the latest adva=\nnces=20\nbeing made in the energy market=01,s systems and  technologies. The confere=\nnce=20\nwill be structured in two streams, offering  delegates and speakers the=20\nchance to tailor the event to their own areas of  interest. The streams wil=\nl=20\nbe partitioned into five areas:=20\n\n1) Information technology for risk management\n\n2) Information technology for pricing and trading\n\n3) Data techniques and strategies\n\n4) Advanced technologies for trading and risk management\n\n5) Challenges of the evolving energy marketplace\n\nEach of these categories will investigate the kind of problems  being faced=\n=20\nby energy IT/IS managers, traders and risk managers alike. I have  attached=\n a=20\ncopy of the program for your information. There will also be a  software=20\nexhibition at the conference at which vendors will be demonstrating  their=\n=20\nproducts, as well as a post-conference seminar on data management.\n\nThis conference will be of the highly technical level that  people have com=\ne=20\nto expect from EPRM events, and I am very keen to encourage  participation=\n=20\nfrom speakers in modifying the program to suit the audience and  issues at=\n=20\nhand. If you have any suggestions or comments on the programme, please  let=\n=20\nme know; any help would be gratefully received.\n\nThis event will be thoroughly marketed through both Energy  & Power Risk=20\nManagement Magazine and our extensive database. It is my aim to  attract th=\ne=20\nleading market players by providing a first-class program with  top-rated=\n=20\nspeakers, making this a highly worthwhile event for the energy  industry.\n\nUnfortunately my schedule for this program is very tight.

  "text": "Sarah, Cindy Olson requested that I forward this to you for further handling.\n\nRosalee\n---------------------- Forwarded by Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron on 07/10/2000 \n08:59 AM ---------------------------\n\n\nBetty Alexander@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT\n07/07/2000 06:37 PM\nTo: Jeff Skilling/Corp/Enron@ENRON\ncc: Joseph W Sutton/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Kenneth \nLay/Corp/Enron@ENRON \nSubject: OK, Jeff, you requested that we be candid about Enron...\n\n\"Management does things right; Leadership does the right things.\" (Peter \nDrucker)\n\nToday I began to wonder if I've been a fool in staunchly defending Enron's \nVisions & Values. \n\nAn esteemed colleague of very strong professional reputation at Enron was \nrecently approached by a hiring supervisor.  Totally unexpected & \nunsolicited, an offer was accepted; all seemed well as this Recruit got good \nfeedback directly from clients & Enron upper mgmt.  But after a short time, \nsuddenly Recruit was told that performance was unsatisfactory.  No specific \nbehaviors or problems were identified as cause; no opportunity given to \nmodify; Recruit was summarily removed to another floor with instructions to \nfind another job.  Upon displacement she told me (~6 weeks ago), \"I want \navoid trouble for anyone; I just want to continue quietly at Enron and forget \nthis.\"  \n\nTo date I have honored her request for silence, but all this hullabaloo about \nEnron being the best place to work makes her dilemma particularly upsetting, \nand there is ample evidence that her plight is not unique.  I refer here to \nCindy Adams, formerly of Joe Sutton's office.  I don't care why it was \ndecided not to use HR's counseling/review process designed to help when \nthings go awry; I just know that Enron's best bet is to give this talented \nprofessional more time.  She writes:\n\n...Last week, my HR Rep informed me that I have a deadline of July 15th in \nwhich to find a job...I have no assistance from HR or Recruiting.  I had 2 \ninterviews 5 weeks ago and I had to initiate those myself.  I've not received \nanswers from postings I've responded to - I am left hanging without \nacknowledgment of any sort.\n\nI have been approached and learned from others that the same thing happened \nto them with the same circumstances; one said that it took her a full 3 \nmonths to land her present job.  I am not afforded that opportunity now ...\n\nJeff, would you please ask someone to remove Cindy's July 15 deadline?  There \nare no rules left to break here; Cindy is trying to proceed diligently & \ndiscreetly, but she is under duress by not having any feedback/support from \nHR.   With a little boost, it's not too late to bring this picture into line \nwith Enron's vision of retaining topnotch people.  \n\nCindy has no idea that I'm writing on her behalf, and after this I intend to \nhonor her wishes with silence.  But you must see the irony here, not to \nmention the double standard in how Enron's Visions & Values are applied to \nassistants all over Enron:  Cindy Adams was sought after, then abruptly put \nout of the office of Joe Sutton, who happens to be our V&V expert!  I'm not \nblaming Joe for anything; he is simply the backdrop in this example.  I \nremember Joe once used an expression at a floor meeting:  \"believing your own \nbaloney.\"  He wasn't talking about Visions & Values then, but \"believing \nbaloney\" suddenly seems to fit for assistants who work at Enron.  You asked \nfor candid; herein I have done my very best to give it to you.\n\nJeff, thanks for asking and listening.  I and my colleagues are listening \ntoo, but seeing is believing.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nBetty Alexander\nSr. Administrative Assistant \n",

Enron and MDA are joining together again to do a 2nd Annual \nBeach Bowl to raise money for MDA. Last year, the event was a great success, \nraising over $70,000.  This year's goal is to raise $100,000, so the \nfundraising benchmarks for all teams have been raised. The money raised will \nbe used to further research for ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease).\n\nI have put together a team of Analyst interns (Howard Goldfarb, Rachel \nMcPhaul, Nicole Brady, Bradley Aiken and myself) for a second year to help in \nthis cause.  The benchmark for the team is the raise $600 (pre-matching), but \nI want to outdo the fundraising of $1400+ (post-matching) we did last year.\n\nI am asking for a donation to MDA to help our team bowl in this event.  \nChecks are payable to MDA.\n\nFYI, Enron matches all donations $20 or more. \n\nThe event will take place on Saturday, July 29, 2000.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\n\nThanks! Have a great day!\n\nTim Ng\nx30998\n\n",

Also, she recommended a photographer out of Atlanta, I \nlove his work, he does candid more so than the traditional portraits. He also \ndid a number of the Kennedy's weddings, etc. I'll try and get a price quote, \nbut I might need your help in negotiations. Also, she send some information \non a decorator/ florist who seems phenomenal, I don't know if Linda might be \nwilling to help me out with that as she knows a lot more about both flowers \nand decoration than I do. The Ballroom at the Ritz is pretty basic and he can \nturn it into anything but basic. Also, that we if we find a church that is \nnot so amazing, he can decorate that as well. \nThe name of the photographer is Dennis Reggie and his number is 404- \n873-8088.  Linda Kessler has all the information on the florist, her number \nis 888 524 1326.\nMom is going to be responsible for the RSVP's for the wedding.  I will get a \nfax machine this weekend. \nLet me know if this is a problem and I will try and arrange some of this from \ndown here, it is just difficult for people to call internationally.\nI love you!\nLiz & Jose Luis",

Also, she recommended a photographer out of Atlanta, I \nlove his work, he does candid more so than the traditional portraits. He also \ndid a number of the Kennedy's weddings, etc. I'll try and get a price quote, \nbut I might need your help in negotiations. Also, she send some information \non a decorator/ florist who seems phenomenal, I don't know if Linda might be \nwilling to help me out with that as she knows a lot more about both flowers \nand decoration than I do. The Ballroom at the Ritz is pretty basic and he can \nturn it into anything but basic. Also, that we if we find a church that is \nnot so amazing, he can decorate that as well. \nThe name of the photographer is Dennis Reggie and his number is 404- \n873-8088.  Linda Kessler has all the information on the florist, her number \nis 888 524 1326.\nMom is going to be responsible for the RSVP's for the wedding.  I will get a \nfax machine this weekend. \nLet me know if this is a problem and I will try and arrange some of this from \ndown here, it is just difficult for people to call internationally.\nI love you!\nLiz & Jose Luis\n\n\n\n",

  "text": "As I promised this morning at the executive committee meeting, below are some \ntalking points for your use.\n\nOverall message:  the market is working, regulation is not.\n\nIn California, peak demand rose by 10% over the last 4 years while new \ncapacity grew by only 2%.  But, as you would expect, the market responded by \nproposing 8,000MW of new generation - - more than enough to offset the peak \ndemand growth.  The regulatory process, at both the state and local level, \nhas failed to site this new generation.  The problem is regulation, not \nderegulation.\n\nWhen San Diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices, \nEnron responded with a fixed price which would have shielded San Diego \ncustomers from price volatility and provided prices below their current \nsummer levels (Enron's price was about $55/MWH).  After publication of \nEnron's offer, nine other companies made offers.  Again, the market responded \nwhere regulation failed.  San Diego has not accepted any of these offers \nbecause of regulatory/legislative restrictions on its ability to buy outside \nof the PX (i.e. the spot market).\n\nIn markets where siting is easier, suppliers have moved to build additional \ngeneration.  Enron built 3 plants in response to the 1998 price spikes.  \nThose plants were planned, sited and built in less that 12 months - - in time \nfor the summer of 1999.  Where regulatory hurdles are lower, the market \nresponds.\n\nThe solution to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition \nnot reregulation.  Policy makers should:\n\nOpen the transmission grid so that power can get from where it is to where it \nis needed.\n\nExpedite interconnection of new generation.\n\nExpedite siting of new facilities.\n\nGive customers a choice, so that they have better access to demand side \nsolutions.\n\n\nAlso attached is a more detailed discussion of California, prepared by Jeff \nDasovich of our San Francisco office.\n",

  "text": "Ken,\n\nI have been working to put together the business agenda for the Management \nConference in November.  The theme I am proposing is \"Reinventing Enron ... \nAgain!\"  I believe the theme is timely as we celebrate our 15 year history \nand address significant changes for the future.  \n\nAttached is a draft of the agenda for your review.  I had an opportunity to \nrun it by Jeff last week.  He was happy with the theme and the first day's \nschedule.  He asked that we keep the second day open given the changes that \nwill likely develop between now and November.  He felt the second day might \nbest be used to establish a new \"manifest\" for the company.   We will, of \ncourse, remain flexible.  However, I am showing you the agenda as Jeff saw it \nas an example of how the day might run.\n\nAlso, on the first day, we'd like to have a spokesperson from Blockbuster \nspeak between Tom Peters and Gary Hamil.  Mr. Peters will help set the theme \nby discussing the need for successful companies to reinvent themselves.  Mr. \nHamil will present tactical strategies for innovation.  Our thought is that a \nBlockbuster spokesperson could discuss their company's experience with \nreinvention -- they are in an interesting situation as the delivery \nmechanisms for their products are evolving.  Would you recommend we invite \nJohn Antioco, chairman & CEO, or Mark Gilman, president of New Media?  \nSeveral have indicated that Mr. Gilman would be a more provocative speaker \nand better equipped to address the theme of reinvention.\n\nI look forward to your feedback and/or suggestions.\n\nThanks,\nTerrie James\n",

That charitable adjective cannot be applied\n> to Dale Robertson, Houston Chronicle sports columnist.\n>\n> Robertson, in his Saturday August 13, 2000 column, established a new low\n> in journalism.  Quoting liberally from the Rocket spokesperson, George\n> Postolos, the Rockets-Comets CEO, according to Robertson, he spews a\n> virulent diatribe of inaccurate, convoluted arguments, misrepresentations,\n> and gratuitous insults.  While conceding the points Judge Eckels made in\n> his recent letter to the Sports Authority may be valid, Robertson,\n> undaunted, attempts to discredit Eckels.  How?  By asking us to believe\n> that Mr. Robertson posses clairvoyant powers.  He warns  his readers of\n> his perception of  the evil state of mind of the Judge. According to\n> Robertson, the arena debate is merely a political struggle, which he\n> blithely characterizes as,  \"Anglo Saxons vs. a Jewish owner and an\n> African-American Mayor\".  Outrageous!

Robertson, far worse, went beyond the pale with his slurs aimed at\n> any party that dares question the current arena deal.  Pitifully sad and\n> counter productive to reaching an Arena agreement the voters will approve.\n>\n> Judge Eckels' temperate, well-reasoned letter, questions a proposal that\n> Arena supporters privately concede \"needs work\".  For example on Channel 2\n> Sunday, Sunny Messiah, the publisher of the Houston Defender, the leading\n> Black newspaper, and an Arena supporter last time around, joined Dan\n> Patrick, a right wing shock jock at the radio station which broadcasts the\n> Rocket's games, in agreeing on the Arena proposal.  That was a first for\n> those two.  Both asked hard questions, concluding it was less fair to the\n> public than the prior agreement rejected by voters.  During the program,\n> viewers were told   that Sports Authority Chairman Billy Burge and Vice\n> Chair Grover Jackson, architects of the agreement, had declined to appear\n> and defend their arrangements with Alexander.\n>\n> There is another matter under discussion that requires clarification.\n>\n> Some assert that Mayor Brown had a 'deal' with Judge Eckels.  I doubt the\n> truth of that claim and will explain why.  All citizens have the\n> constitutionally protected right to speak out, and public officials such\n> as Brown and Eckels have a duty to speak up on behalf of the taxpayers.\n> Surely Robertson and the defenders of the constitutionally protected\n> rights of the press would not condemn, or attempt to muzzle, anyone's\n> right to free speech.  Eckels was right to state his concerns.  If the\n> hour is late, blame the Sports Authority and Alexander who have been\n> negotiating since their last deal was rejected in 1999.  Remember this is\n> Alexander's third bite at the apple.  He lost last year and walked away\n> from negotiations back when Bob Lanier was Mayor.  It is late but we have\n> two years to go on the Rocket's lease at the Compaq Center and that could\n> be temporarily extended if necessary.\n>\n> The assertion that Mayor Brown stayed out of the Stadium negotiations is\n> simply not true.\n>\n> That agreement between Harris County, the NFL, the Rodeo and the Sports\n> Authority, was concluded and executed during my term as Chairman of the\n> Sports Authority.  The Mayor contacted us on several occasions with input.\n> It was due to his correct insistence that the stadium be designed to\n> accommodate expansion for the 2012 Summer Olympic games.  The change, over\n> the NFL's objection, added significantly to the cost, but represents a\n> wise investment for a growing region.  In fact, Mayor Brown will recall,\n> we made the final break through in those negotiations, in his   office,\n> reaching closure when he and Commissioner Lee reached agreement on major\n> sticking points between the County and the City.  Mayor Brown's leadership\n> and input was important to our ultimate success in bringing the NFL back\n> to Houston.  Judge Eckels' input will be equally important in fashioning\n> an Arena agreement that the voters will approve.\n>\n>  Robertson and the Chronicle evidently missed all those events, or fail to\n> understand their ramifications.  He conveniently dismisses   the last 'top\n> down, cram down' deal on the Arena that the voter's slammed dunked.  We\n> can't afford another failure due to yet another open-ended, capitulation\n> to Alexander's demands.  The voters are not stupid and will not be\n> intimidated.\n>\n>\n> It is a disservice when we lower the debate to name calling and\n> questioning of motives.

We\ninvite you to serve as our opening keynote speaker at the kick off luncheon\non Wednesday, April 25 to help set the tone, goals and objectives for this\nevent.\n\nOur theme is \"2001: An Energy Odyssey.\" We are using the conference to\nshowcase the role of economics in developing markets for energy, and to\ndeal with issues that impede, or facilitate, market development as well as\nenterprise strategy and metamorphosis.  We can think of no one better to\nclearly define these major themes and priorities than you.\n\nI was a speaker and delegate at the World Forum on Energy Regulation in\nMontreal last May, and greatly enjoyed your luncheon keynote (and hope that\nthe regulators and policy makers attending the Forum took your key points t=\no\nheart).  The thoughts you offered -- on the importance of standards, the\nopportunities to build network platforms and Enron's own experience, are of\nvital importance to IAEE/USAEE members.  We would ask you to include\ncomments on the fundamental importance of economic principles in both\nguiding market development and the efforts of those of us who operate in\nmarkets on behalf of enterprises.\n\nThe IAEE remains the largest worldwide combination of industry, business an=\nd\nuniversity interests engaged in energy development and policy.  To bring yo=\nu\nup-to-date on the association, our Web site is www.iaee.org. I'm sure\nRosilea will have someone on her staff pull the relevant materials together\nfor you. I have also included the call for papers for the Houston conferenc=\ne\n(at the end of this mail) which lines out the major sessions and topics. In\naddition to our invitation to you, we are inviting Mark Moody-Stuart of\nRD/Shell for the April 26 keynote luncheon to address environmental issues\nand Rilwanu Lukman, Secretary General of OPEC (and a member of IAEE), in a\njoint session with the Board of Directors of the Offshore Technology\nConference on Friday, to cover worldwide outlooks for oil and gas.\n\nFinally, as you know, Enron Corp. for some time has been a corporate\nsponsor of our UH Energy Institute and the previous Natural Gas Project,\nwhich you helped to found.  Thus, we also are relying on Rob Bradley to hel=\np\nidentify and implement the major environmental themes for the plenary\nsession, \"Sustaining Development\" (yes, we indeed are trying to turn\nthinking around with our re-phrasing).\n\nI hope to hear from Rosilea soon on your interest and availability.

Enron is mentioned but not interviewed so I didn't know\nif you would have access to a copy.\n\nTake care,\nMary Elizabeth\n\nLink to article:\n\nhttp://www.cvmag.com/contents/2000/0814/vod814.asp\n\nCut and paste:\nVideo on the Move\nDropping costs and rising competition are forcing operators to see\nvideo-on-demand in a whole new light\nBY SIMON APPLEBAUM\nAt VOD programmer Diva, the deployment forecast gets more specific, as does\nthe rationale behind why operators will push the action. Three factors come\ninto play:\n* DBS penetration continues to fly and bite off operators' best customers;\n* the plunging expense of video-server hardware and video-stream\ntransmissions, which make moot the big, prohibitive load operators have used\nto justify not deploying VOD;\n* the fallout from Time Warner's deal to merge with America Online --\nnamely, considerable encouragement to accelerate plans in every other\nconvergence direction they want to travel, be it digital cable services\n(including near-VOD and tiers), high-speed Web surfing through cable modems,\nor interactive TV.\nThus with cost and infrastructure concerns put aside, and competition\nstaring them in the face, operators see VOD in a new light. Now that DBS\nreaches 13 million subs \"and is heading for 20 million, cable is feeling the\npain,\" says Diva president David Zucker. \"Every one of the eight largest\ncable operators, every single one, will deploy or trial VOD in some manner.\nThe big rollouts will start the second half of the year.\" If they come, they\nmay hear another set of competitive footsteps entering the scene. Digital\nsubscriber line carriers such as SBC and Qwest, hunting for high-speed\nInternet households, are poised to reach out and become must-see VOD TV\nthrough Viacom subsidiary Blockbuster. With infrastructure help from Enron\nBroadband Services, Blockbuster will deploy a movies-driven VOD service in a\nnumber of cities by December, and all over the U.S. next year. The joint\nventure will go after cable and DBS distribution, but off the bat, DSL will\nbe in the driver's seat, as routed through SBC, Qwest and other suppliers.\nBut right now, reality is nowhere near the perception Jacobsen and Zucker\nsuggest. Few multi-system owners have VOD formats fully deployed or in\ntrial; most MSOs don't, even though they are deep in digital-service\nlaunches incorporating near-VOD, which takes up 30 channels or more of a\nsystem's lineup. Video-on-demand, on the other hand, uses far fewer channels\nthan NVOD, because video servers, placed at or near the system's headend,\nstore the programming and transmit it on addressable command from\nsubscribers, any time, over streaming transmissions. How high is the payoff\nfor mass cable adoption? Try 40 to 60 percent, by 2010, of the multi-billion\ndollar revenue pot home-video companies enjoy now, predicted Merrill Lynch\nsenior media analyst Jessica Reif-Cohen at the recent Myers interactive-TV\nforum in New York.\nWhere the Action Is\nYou need more than one hand to count the number of VOD projects happening\naround the country, but you don't need many more. Here's the scorecard:\n * Diva - VOD's veteran packager is doing full-deployment business in at\nleast 10 areas. Affiliates include AT&T Broadband in Marin County, Calif.\n(outside San Francisco) and Atlanta (formerly MediaOne turf); Charter\nCommunications in the Atlanta suburbs; and a growing number of Insight\nCommunications locales (Columbus, Ohio; Rockford, Ill.; and Evansville,\nInd.) where VOD is bundled with Source Media's Local Source interactive-TV\nservice. Before Labor Day, Charter will add Diva to at least one of its Los\nAngeles-area systems. More than 400 titles, from movie blockbusters to\nspecial-interest videos, are available each month. Top films go for $3.95 a\npop, while classic flicks and other titles get priced at $2.95 or below.\nAvailable attractions include library shows from ESPN, TNT, Discovery and\nother cable nets. About 15,000 subs use the service at least once a month.\n * Time Warner - Cable's second-largest operator is in full VOD blast,\nfollowing a trial run in Austin, Texas, last summer. Honolulu became the\nfirst Time Warner locale to make VOD available system-wide earlier this\nyear, covering about 250,000 subs. Tampa, Fla., turned on in June, according\nto Concurrent Computer, which provides servers and streaming tech to Time\nWarner. About 100,000 Tampa-area subs are getting their day in the VOD sun.\n* Intertainer - After two years of development and tests, the VOD player\nthat includes Microsoft, Comcast, NBC, Sony and Intel among its equity\nstakeholders will soon premiere in Comcast's suburban Baltimore system. That\nfollows DSL rollouts in U S West's Denver enterprise and Cincinnati under an\nindependent franchiser. The service has plenty of interactive features to\naccompany the content, including opportunities to order an artist's CD after\nwatching his music video; local information retrieval; and e-commerce\nchoices. Intertainer CEO Jonathan Taplin promises a \"stunning\"\nMSO-affiliation announcement over the next few weeks.\n* In Demand - PPV's kingpin player was already talking to affiliates about\nVOD rollouts and trials when new president Stephen Brenner assumed his post\nearlier this summer (see sidebar, p. 30).\n* TVN - In Demand's closest PPV/NVOD rival, whose affiliate base consists of\nmid-size and small system owners, is in the midst of several VOD technical\nand marketing trials. Some rollout announcements are expected early this\nfall. Like Diva and Intertainer, TVN wants to combine programming with\ninteractive applications.\n * DemandVideo - This California-based firm surfaced this spring, initially\non a quest for cable overbuilder affiliates so that they wouldn't be absent\nfrom VOD activity. Seren Innovations (which runs its systems under Astound\nCable TV) and Knology signed up before the National Cable TV Association\nconvention, and Seren put Demand's format through a 25-home trial in St.\nCloud, Minn. But at NCTA's show in May, Demand CEO Rajiv Juluria insisted\nthat his product will be available to all comers, entrenched or encroacher.\nKnology will launch the service among hotels in Panama City, Fla., while\nSeren commits to a full St. Cloud rollout, plus deployment in Contra Costa\nCounty, Calif.\n* E-Video TV - A new VOD player out of Scottsdale, Ariz., E-Video has\ndeveloped download technology through which digital cable subs can retrieve\nfeature films, programming and interactive games. Roy Bennett, E-Video's\npresident, says his firm will try the process out with a cable operator\nbefore summer ends.\nUp ahead in the player pipeline: StreamBox and AlwaysonTV.com, two ventures\nrunning both video and Internet content. Both exhibited two months ago at\nStreaming Media East in New York. Within VOD's own tech vendordom --\ncompanies that provide video servers and program-insertion gear to operators\n-- there's growing consensus that the on-demand era launches this fall. How\nfast VOD takes off is more in the hands of set-top box providers than MSOs,\nbelieves Concurrent CEO Steve Nussrallah. The sooner they flood the scene\nwith digital converters, the sooner deployments happen.  \"We're at the front\ndoor of an explosion. Late fall or early next year is the right time for\nthis market to happen,\" he says. \"The only thing holding the market back is\nthe ability of set-top vendors to build and ship their product at a level\nequal to the demand. By the end of 2004, we should be north of 30 million\ndigital set-tops, with the vast majority of them VOD-enabled. Deployment by\noperators becomes a no-brainer.\" AOL Time Warner will push operators into\ndeployment decisions, adds nCube president Michael Pohl. \"The convergence of\nTime Warner's content with the broadband opportunities AOL looks at will\ndrive the content and availability of content for VOD,\" Pohl suggests.\n\"Movies are OK and great, probably a good place to start, but ultimately,\nviewers want to go to their operator and ask for whatever they want to see.\"\n\"You see the operators showing excitement for VOD now, as opposed to the\nvendors showing excitement, which is what it was for the last few years,\"\nsays Yvette Gordon, interactive technologies VP at SeaChange Technologies.\n\"The AOL-Time Warner merger helps.\"\nThe Naysayers\nBut many people don't buy it. Take Playboy Television -- they're supplying\nproduct to selected Diva and Time Warner VOD markets. They're in the game,\nbut Playboy TV president Jim English doesn't look for a breakout market\nuntil 2002. Why? Despite big declines in server cost, \"you need so many per\nstate, so many per [sub universe],\" English reasons. \"The more subs on the\nline, the slower the traffic goes. It's still very expensive electronics.\nI'm not trying to poke holes at anyone, but a lot of projections about this\nindustry didn't come out as advertised. How many years did it take for\ndigital cable to move? Even now, operators have more trucks dedicated to\ninstalling high-speed cable modems than digital cable. And on cable's agenda\npriority scale, just getting the digital box in is number one.\" For\nSusquehanna Communications and Classic Cable, 2001 is the year VOD will make\nit to their systems, provided the tech issues English raises get resolved.\nAs big as the case is for getting economics down enough for deployment among\nlarge MSOs, it's magnified several times over for owners the size of\nSusquehanna and Classic.  \"Insight, for example, can serve tens or hundreds\nof thousands of customers from a single headend. The best we can do is 7,000\ncustomers from a single headend. For the small, non-metro markets we\nservice, how do you amortize the cost for initial equipment installation?\"\nasks Classic CEO Merritt Belisle. \"When you take into account the\nflexibility and long-term viability of the tech, and different content\navenues, there's a lot that's nascent and in development,\" responds Dan\nTemplain, Susquehanna's corporate marketing/programming director. \"The\ncontent and the tech have to become compelling enough to consumers that\nwe're willing to roll it out.\" Still, Templain's company is determined to do\na field trial somewhere this fall, and get deployment underway before the\nend of next March. \"That's accelerated thinking from where we were six\nmonths ago.\" To SVOD or Not to SVOD? On the programming side, the train\neveryone wants to be aboard is making VOD a diverse medium, perhaps to the\npoint where the medium should be relabeled \"COD\" -- for content-on-demand.\nMovies, available at or earlier than home-video release, lead the way, but\nnot far behind are sports, live/taped events from all over, how-to and\nspecial-interest videos, children's fare, games, adult entertainment and a\nfew genres spun out of the imagination of others.  \"There may be\nlocalized-content opportunities,\" chirps In Demand's Jacobsen. \"Local\ntheater, high school football games with real community value.\" In a COD\nworld, \"you're not limited to video product,\" says TVN senior business\ndevelopment VP Jim Riley. \"Eventually, you download computer software so you\ncan view it on your TV as well as on your PC. That's where we're driving\nsome of our development energies.\" TVN's vehicle is Chromazone, involving\nCalifornia-based venture capitalist Digital Evolution. From the start,\nIntertainer has embraced a link of COD with interactive elements. \"If MSOs\nmake the investment in VOD, they must maximize it with advertising,\ne-commerce and all sorts of interactivity,\" says Jonathan Taplan,\nIntertainer's president and CEO. \"That's the ultimate promise. If you think\nabout the capital investment and the possible return in gross revenues, like\n$20 a sub per month, that's a damn good business.\" Diva, infused with $9\nmillion earlier this summer from operating system/middleware players OpenTV\nand Liberate Technologies (CV, 7/17/00, p. 98), now has economic backing to\npursue its own interactive-integration course. And soon, cable operators\nwill see if their VOD future should incorporate subscription\nvideo-on-demand, or SVOD. Encore Media Group, under CEO John Sie, is betting\na substantial chunk of its future on it, and in a matter of weeks, AT&T\nBroadband's newly acquired Atlanta system (off the completed MediaOne\nmerger) will test SVOD out using Encore, Starz! and Encore's multiplex\nmovies. Here's the SVOD deal, as Sie explains it: Premium service subs, for\nan extra fee, get 20-30 titles running on that service that month on-demand,\nwith VCR functionality. The subs watch those films whenever they want, as\nmany times as they want, for that one fee. Six or eight dollars a month will\ndo. \"We're using VOD as a viewer enhancement platform,\" Sie insists. \"Movies\nwill drive things first. Once they drive penetration, you can do\nsubscription news-on-demand and other things on-demand.\" Lately, Sie's SVOD\nadvocacy comes framed inside a clarion call to move operators in the\ndirection of all-digital system conversion. Direct broadcast satellite\nservices are that way now, and Sie believes cable system owners have two\nyears at most to make that transition, contrary to the seven-to-10-year\ntimeframe other industry execs predict. \"You know and I know consumer demand\nfor digital far exceeds set-top box availability, as well as the supply of\ninstallation crews. DBS realized that and now they're ramping up,\" Sie\nbelieves. But opponents find two flaws in SVOD: Because the product is\navailable in the premium window, six months or more after PPV availability,\nthere may not be as much audience demand for it compared to pre-PPV.\nIndependent of audience demand, there's the specter of cannibalization,\nwhere on-demand use comes at the expense of premium-channel viewing. \"Here's\na way to enhance and optimize premium services,\" Nussrallah concludes. \"If\nyou get constant access to the programming, it's more customer-friendly, and\nsomething DBS can't provide. Cable is built on the concept that the audience\nbuys more if they have more choice and convenience. It may be the next\nopportunity window.\" Not so, Taplin figures. \"It would be cool to get all of\nThe Sopranos on a VOD package. But why would people who already see movies\non premium pay for more of those same movies, after they've had the chance\nto watch those movies in an on-demand way. Unless Sie prices it so low, or\nunless they like those movies a lot, why would they pay again? The flat-fee\nmodel is a great model, like cellular-phone pricing. People love paying one\nfee for unlimited monthly use. But the window isn't the right window.\" Sie\ndefends SVOD as an enhancement option. \"Would an operator launch digital\ncable with pay TV only and not launch PPV, concluding that PPV cannibalizes\npay, or vice versa? No, because they complement each other beautifully. Same\nhere.\" Other VOD programmers and tech vendors will pursue SVOD experiments.\nTVN is investigating one or more affiliate partnerships for a test. Classic\nand Susquehanna are open to proposals. \"What John says is super. What does\nit cost me? I've got a stock market and bond market to work with,\" Belisle\nsays.\nStream Thinking\nSusquehanna exec Templain calls SVOD \"a work in progress platform.\" Others\nsay the same about streamed video content, another pot worthy of industry\nexploitation. \"Spectacular\" may be the most accurate adjective for the\nassortment of video Internet sites have streamed to PC households\neverywhere, from quirky animation to short films to news clips. More\ndiverse, longer streamed content is coming down the pike. Will the very same\ntech making mass VOD deployment possible now also make possible a new\noriginal content pipe? What an ironic circumstance. Check in with the sites\nthemselves, from Real Networks on down, and the masterminds behind them\npoint to TV and cable display as their final destination. Fifty million PCs,\nmore than 100 million TV homes, almost 70 percent of them cabled -- the\nmarket's obvious to them. In the end, that's the ticket, cable execs concur.\nBut for the near term, no. The broadcast quality's not there yet (although\ntech strides are happening), and there's considerable fear that producers\nwill use streaming to bypass cable nets. Gordon targets mid to late 2001 as\nthe point where streamed content will be TV/VOD-suitable. Assuming the\nindustry locks its fears away, nCube's Pohl sides with the crowd awaiting\n\"this kind of ubiquitous media, where things go to the TV or PC.\" \"We're\nsleeping fine at night about this, because the quality is not there yet,\"\nadds Diva's Zucker. \"But we will make video streaming a Holy Grail for TV in\nthe next few years, and cable will be uniquely positioned to take advantage\nof it.\" *\n\n <<...>>\nHOME </> | CURRENT ISSUE </contents/2000/0814/> | BACK ISSUES </contents/> |\nDATABASE </database/> | LINKS </links/> | ABOUT US </about_cv/>  All\ncontents , 2000 Cahners Business Information. <http://www.cahners.com> All\nrights reserved.

  "text": "Ken:\n\nOne of the initiatives implemented at Global Strategic Souring since its \nformation in February is to leverage Enron's aggregated purchasing power to \nfacilitate commercial development opportunities for the Business (EBS, EES, \nEFS, and etc.) Units.\n\nAnnually, Enron spends several million dollars with COMPAQ for servers, desk \ntop computers, and lap top computers.  COMPAQ has also been selected as one \nof the potential candidates to service the EnHome program.  COMPAQ is also \none of EBS's alliance partners.\n\nGiven the magnitude of Enron's relationship with COMPAQ, we have formed an \nintercompany team comprised of representatives from EBS, EES, EFS, Global \nStrategic Sourcing, and the EnHome Program.  In our most recent meeting the \nbusiness units reported the following:\n\nCOMPAQ has failed to define its requirements for EBS services under the \ncurrent alliance agreement between the companies.  COMPAQ has also denied EBS \naccess to expertise and installations required for product refinement and \nimplementation.  (Based on the feedback I have received, I question whether \nCOMPAQ intends to honor the terms and conditions of its relationship with \nEBS).\nEFS only provides building services currently to a couple of Compaq's \ninstallations.  \nEES has been in discussions with COMPAQ for several months now.  Although we \nare progressing, it would appear that we are at an impasse on the language in \nthe contract necessary to support the transaction.\nOn the EnHome program, COMPAQ has generally been unresponsive to our \nquestions and concerns for clarification and/or additional information on \ntheir experience in operating this type of program.\nThe Widows 2000 Roll-out Contract literally has taken months to complete when \nit should have only been a matter of weeks.\n\nKen, based on what I am seeing day-to-day, I am concerned that COMPAQ has \nlost sight of the value of our total business and the value of a healthy, \nbidirectional relationship.\n\nTherefore, specifically given the unresponsiveness to our most recent \nrequests for clarification on the EnHome Program and our concerns regarding \nthere ability to operate a program of this magnitude, I have requested that \nwe reopen discussions with IBM and DELL.\n\nI will keep you apprised of future developments.\n\nGeorge Wasaff",

  "text": "Hi Mr. Moore -\n\nI'm sorry that we didn't discuss dates this morning as Mr. Lay is on vacation \nuntil September 5.  As that will be his first week back after being out for \nseveral weeks, it is already pretty booked up. \n\nI will certainly share this e-mail with him.  Is it possible to update Mr. \nLay on the progress of the Committee to Encourage Corporate Philanthropy by \ne-mail?  Another thought might be to see if our Executive Vice President of \nHuman Resources, Cindy Olson,  would be available to meet with you on August \n28 or 29.  Ms. Olson is in charge of Enron's Community Relations Department.\n\nPlease advise.\n\nRosalee\n\n\n\n\n\"Charles Moore\" <CHMoore1@email.msn.com> on 08/21/2000 04:14:08 PM\nTo: <kenneth.lay@enron.com>\ncc:  \nSubject: Committee to Encourage Corporate Philanthropy\n\n\n\nI would like to schedule a short meeting in your office to  share the \nremarkable progress that the Committee to Encourage Corporate  Philanthropy \nis making and to ask that you consider hosting a meeting for  ten to fifteen \nCEOs of other major Houston corporations to encourage their  participation in \nthe only forum of CEOs focused on the agenda of corporate  giving.\n?\nI'm anxious to meet you as we have so many friends in  common: three of your \ndirectors, John Duncan, Pug Winokur and Norm Blake, and  the Slocums, to name \njust a few.\n?\nI look forward to hearing from you.\n?\n?\nP.S. If it works in your schedule, I'm available to come  to Houston on \nAugust 28 or 29 or anytime the week of September  4.\n\n",

I'm working at it! \n\nRosalie said you'd be getting in this afternoon, and I? wanted to reach you \nby phone or e-mail before Governor Tony Knowles from Alaska calls you.? \nGovernor Knowles (classmate of George W.), along with Governor Taft of Ohio, \nhas enlisted us in a conference that seven governors are sponsoring on \nnatural gas in order to elucidate the market and issues -- and needs -- \nbefore it explodes as a political issue -- and perhaps helps head it off (in \ncontrast to what happened with gasoline).? Governor Knowles is the current \nchairman of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission, and it will be under the \nauspices of the IOCC.?

Both the NYSE and the NASDAQ plan to gradually change over\nto decimals to comply with the SEC's mandate of total decimal conversion by\nApril 9, 2001.

  "text": "Greg and Louise,\n\nThanks for taking time out of  your schedule to spend some time with Alph\nBingham and me this week.  You and your team are breaking new ground in\nyour business with impressive speed.  We hope to match that type of\nperformance within e.Lilly.\n\nI had several key takeaways that were notewothy:\n\n1. Build your e.commerce strategy from the customer's perspective.  Louise,\nyou demonstrated this by the intense focus on the traders' requirements for\nEnronOnline.\n2. As Peter Drucker points out in his 1994 article on the \"Theory of\nBusiness\", you must have clear assumptions about your environment, mission\nand core competencies.  The establishment of Enron Networks seems to be\nbuilt upon your strong ability to assess a potential market for\ncommoditization and then leverage your strong trading capabilities and\ncontrol processes in order to create or redefine the market(eg. pulp/paper,\nsteel,bandwidth).\n3. You provide people a chance to understand the business and be\naccountable early in their career.  The example of one of your top traders\nillustrated the performance-based culture that you are developing while\nother examples showed the business breadth that is provided to key talent.\n4. In the new economy (probably in the old one, too), there is no defense,\nonly offense.  Again, that mantra seems to grow out of a strong bias for\naction within Enron Networks as you recognize that you must re-create\nyourself (Online gas market) and move aggressively into new ones.\n5. Louise, your EnronOnline initiative epitomized the phrase:  \"Ask for\nforgiveness, not for permission.\"  In other words, get it done; get it done\nright, and the little things - like the budget - will take care of\nthemselves.\n\nLet me know if we can ever return the favor.  Greg, we may want to discuss\na few risk management questions with you sometime in the future as we are\nbuilding some innovative discovery research ventures that would benefit\nfrom your insight in this area.\n\nThanks again for your time.  Please thank Liz Taylor for us as well.  She\nwas very helpful.\n\nRegards,\n\nNewt Crenshaw",

  "text": "Dear MaryAnn,\n\nI was very disappointed to learn today that the Enron Body Shop will be\nraising its rates to $25 per month.  While this may be in line with some\nbenchmarking study, one would hope that Enron would seek to outperform its\npeers, given its goal to be rated #1 as best place to work.  Our cross-town\ncompetitor Williams, where I worked for almost 12 years, has a facility that\nis at least as good as Enron's, and there is no charge whatsoever.  Why\ncharge for the use of a facility that promotes Wellness?\n\nI hope you reconsider this increase, but at a minimum provide a lower rate\nfor the occasional user such as myself.  Given my busy schedule I am lucky\nto get there a few times per month, and would happily pay the greater of $5\nper visit or the $25/month fee.  A $25/month fee will simply discourage\noccasional users.\n\nPlease terminate my membership, effective September 1.

  "text": "Mr. Lay, I am a 59 1/2 year old employee that last saw you at my 25 year \naward celebration in Houston in 1993.  Since that time, I have had some \nhealth problems that are leading me to retire a little early from Enron, on \nAugust 31, 2000. \n\n I did not want to leave Enron's active employment until I had the \nopportunity to express to you my gratitude.  I have been with Northern \nNatural Gas, InterNorth, HNG-InterNorth and Enron for thirty two years and 1 \nmonth.  I can tell you without hesitation, that since you took over our \ncompany in the late 80's, it has been the most challenging and exciting time \nthat I have spent in my work life.  I had opportunities that I never dreamt \nof and I am grateful for the opportunities that I have had.   I started on \nAugust 1, 1968 as a maintenance helper at the South Omaha location of \nNorthern Natural Gas.  I was a field technician, an O&M Supervisor, a \nDistrict Manager, and presently the Manager of the Operations Communications \nCenter in Omaha.\n\nI have admired and respected you since the first time we met in Des Moines, \nIowa, shortly after the merger.  Without your guidance and direction and the \nmany employee based programs you have initiated, I would not be where I am \nfinancially today.  I am looking forward to retirement without concern for me \nor my family's future.  The ESOP program was so very important to all of the \nemployees, and the many other programs like our \"options\", variable pay \n(bonus) and others make Enron a leader throughout the world in employee \nsatisfaction, and we have the awards to prove it.\n\nThe employees that I have worked with in these 32 years are the bright spots \nfor Enron, not only in the past but also into the future.  We have done a \nwonderful job of getting the best of the best.\n\nI hope that I will be able to thank you in person and shake your hand once \nmore, perhaps at a future shareholders meeting.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRod Williams\n\n\n",

  "text": "Ken:\n\nVery shortly after we spoke, I was informed that we had lost the Enron\nHomePC Program. This is a great emotional blow to us and I am beyond\ndisappointed.\n\nWe understood that given our recent  strong performance against Dell, they\nwould do anything to embarrass us in our own backyard.  We have very strong\ninsight into their intent and knew they would  use this aggressively in\ntheir PR campaigns.\n\nHowever, clearly it was our job to win the business on the merits of the\nindividual program and to compete hard for it. We believed that we had a\ncreative offer on the table that would create great value for your\nemployees. Obviously, we did not perform to your expectations.\n\nFollowing is the summary of our activities together which was created before\nwe heard the news.\n\nI pride myself in developing strong executive relationships with our\ncustomers, and I would welcome the opportunity for us to put our heads\ntogether in order to look for ways we can move the relationships between our\ntwo companies to a higher level.\n\nI also think we should discuss the PR positioning. As a member of our Board,\nand as a leader in the Houston community this will be news and I am hopeful\nwe can find a creative way to balance it.\n\nAgain, I accept it was ours to win in the marketplace but regret it had to\ncome to this. I look forward to your call.\n\nM\n\n\n\n\nFrom our Enron team:\n\n\n\n* EBS Product and Service Supply Agreement\n\nCompaq will continue to honor the Product and Service Supply Agreement\nexecuted on January 18 between EBS and Compaq, whereby Compaq agreed to\npurchase broadband services from EBS (on a take or pay basis) in proportion\nto EBS' purchase of NT servers and attached storage.  It is also important\nto note that we have been actively partnering with EBS on non-contractual\nareas, such as our ongoing technical joint development and marketing efforts\naround the Windows Streaming Media product.  I understand that our teams\nhave been working very closely together -- and with Microsoft -- to resolve\ntechnical issues with Windows Streaming Media and thereby speed EBS' market\ndeployment.\n\nThe major issue is that Enron does not support traffic to many of our\nconcentration point so we need to be creative.\n\nBottom line, we are down to solvable problems with solution activities\nunderway.\n\n* Windows 2000\n\n\nDuring the last week of May Compaq responded to a request from Enron to\nsupport Windows 2000 deployments, and placed people on site with no defined\ncontract or process due to Enron's requirements.  At this writing, no\ncontract has been signed, and the current contract iteration is at number\nfourteen.  Apparently the delivery scope has changed several times and there\nhave been a few mistrals. Compaq is continuing to provide resources despite\nthe fact that no contract is in place and will work with Enron to ensure a\nsuccessful completion of the project.\n\n* Power Management\n\nJesse Greene, our CFO, will act as the contact point for Enron for power\nmanagement services. The issue is we have existing contracts at favorable\nrates but we will break the log jam.\n\n* HomePC Program\n\nFor several months, Compaq and Enron have been working the solution to bring\ntechnology and Internet access into the homes of every Enron employee.\nThere have been many creative discussions around hardware and financing to\nallow Enron to fully subsidize the package provided.  Compaq, Enron and\nCompaq Financial Services had gotten to a point where the $35 per month cap\nwas going to require the specifications of the hardware to be reduced.  In\nrecognition of the value of our partnership and our mutual desire for this\nprogram to be the premier program in the industry, we have increased the\nspecifications of the hardware while taking significant pricing actions and\nfinancing rate reductions.  These actions will actually allow Enron to\nsupport better than expected hardware with the extended warranty for $34.28\nper month.   This will truly be an industry-leading program when launched\nlater this fall.",

I was able to form this alliance specifically\nto go after your business because 4 of the top officers at Trammell Crow are\nfriends of mine.  Don Williams (Chairman), Pryor Blackwell  (COO), Chuck\nAnderson (Regional President) and Mike Lafitte (President Dallas and Blake\nPoston's Godfather).  In fact, Trammell Crow is hosting a golf tournament in\nOctober that will raise $70,000 for Rise Dallas!\n\nMike Lafitte is the only one who knows that Enron is the potential prospect.\nSo, if I have my nose where it does not belong I can shut it down without\nany fanfare.\n\nCould there be an opportunity to meet with Enron to sell Trammell Crow\nSavills for your London and/or European real estate needs?\n\nIt's a long shot, I know.

  "text": "Here is this months report. It is good to report solid momentum and good\nmorale in all regions and this report highlights a number of great\nsuccesses. Clearly we have had supply challenges so non-linear quarter\nagain, as you well know.  We shall be working September hard!\n\nRegards\nPeter\n\n\n\n[Compaq Confidential - Internal Use Only]\n\nWorldwide Sales & Services team:\n\nMy travel report this month spans the Americas - from our operations in\nLatin America to those in Canada.  I had many opportunities to visit with\nour sales and services employees as well as customers, partners, press and\nanalysts.  It's really great to have a role that brings me into regular\ncontact with employees and our external audiences - it's very exciting to\nsee how the momentum is building around the Corporation.\n\nLatin America has been very successful in its direct and partner\ninitiatives, particularly in Argentina, where we are now 55% direct, and\nBrazil which has 60% direct business.  Our LA e-Business Development team is\nmaking tremendous strides to strategically position our business in the fast\ngrowing Internet space, while opening up new and exciting revenue streams.\nIn just four months of existence, the team has completed several new\nalliances with companies investing in the huge growth potential of the\nInternet in the region.  Key alliances in this exciting new \"ecosystem\"\ninclude:\n\nDiveo, a provider of integrated hosting and security services, secures\nCompaq's position as preferred vendor for this potentially huge customer.\nIt also allows us to offer critical enabling services that will accelerate\nthe adoption of the Internet and many valuable services in the region.\n\nWe entered a strategic alliance agreement with Artikos, a joint venture\nbetween Commerce One and Banamex, the largest bank in Mexico.  The terms of\nthe alliance permit Compaq to sell the Commerce One solution to the many\noff-line and on-line companies investing in B2B marketplaces.  It also\npositions us to participate as strategic partners in new marketplaces being\nformed by established brick-and-mortar players.\n\nOur strategic alliance with Terra, a leading regional portal, has begun to\ngenerate exciting new revenue streams stemming from a customer\nacquisition/traffic arrangement using our Presario keyboard buttons.  In\njust four months of operation, we successfully sent 12 million visitors to\nthe Terra portal and gained from traffic and revenue sharing arrangements\nthat form part of the alliance.\n\nPatagon.com - Our first Internet alliance, at a time when few, if any,\ncompanies recognized the Internet's potential in Latin America, continues to\npay important dividends.  Patagon.com has grown to become the leading\nfinancial portal in LA with the help of Compaq technology.  We also are\nhelping sustain Patagon's growth in the market through a revenue generating\ntraffic alliance that links our customers to Patagon's portal through our\neasy access keyboard buttons.\n\nIn the coming months, you will surely be hearing more about these and other\nnew alliances that are transforming Compaq into a leading e-business in the\nregion.\n\nCanadian highlights\nMy trip north yielded not only relief from the Texas heat, but also many\nother great examples of progress that contributed to our Q2 results.  As you\nprobably know, David Booth, a 13-year veteran with Compaq and Digital, was\nnamed President and Managing Director of our Canada operations in May.  In\nQ2, the region increased their profits by 88% over Q299 and helped return\nCPCG to profitability.  Earlier this year, Compaq Canada launched eStore\noperations, and with other direct enhancements, expects to be 85% direct by\nthe end of this year.  Their Consumer Call Centre is racking up awards too -\nboth as Compaq Call Center of the Year, and from Call Center Magazine as the\nHigh Technology Call Center of the Year.  Product awards in Canada include:\n - ProLiant server received Computer Dealer News' 2000 Reseller\nChoice Award\n - Deskpro PC received ChannelLine Magazine's 2000 ChannelLine\nChamps Award\n - Aero/iPAQ Pocket PCs became the first monitoring devices for\ndiabetes in the world through Charles H. Best Diabetes Centre\n\nAnd last, but certainly not least, some great wins:  Banque Nationale, $2.1M\nfor Himalaya systems and services; Province of New Brunswick, $2M for MS\nExchange; Capital Health Region, $2M Deskpro/Armada PCs; Lotto Quebec, $1.5M\nfor Himalaya systems; CanJet, $1.5M for ProLiant servers; SoftChoice, $800K\nfor SANs; Ontario Lottery Corporation, $800K ProLiant servers; University of\nToronto, $790K Alpha Cluster; SaskTel, $700K Deskpro PCs; and Atlantic\nHealth Science Centre,  $500K AlphaServer systems\n.\n\nWorld's fastest and most powerful supercomputer\nToday we are announcing that the U.S. Department of Energy's National\nNuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has selected Compaq to build the\nworld's fastest and most powerful supercomputer, a 30+ TeraOPS system\ncode-named \"Q.\"  The contract is valued at more than $200M, and the\nsupercomputer will be housed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los\nAlamos, New Mexico.  The supercomputer will support NNSA's integrated\nprogram of surveillance, experiments, non-nuclear tests, archived data,\nmodeling and simulation to assess and certify the safety, security and\nreliability of nuclear weapons without underground nuclear testing.\n\nThe supercomputer will consist initially of some 375 AlphaServer GS320\nsystems (approximately 12,000 Alpha processors) with EV68 CPUs running in\nexcess of 1,250 MHz on our Tru64UNIX operating system.  Almost the size of\nfive basketball courts (more than 21,000 square feet), the system will have\nmore than 600 terabytes of Compaq StorageWorks storage, and receive onsite\n24x7 service and support.  This major win, plus other recent wins (see\nNational Science Foundation below) are expected to establish Compaq as the\nNo. 1 provider in the high performance technical systems and servers\nmarketplace before the end of this year.  A great recognition for Compaq,\nthe Business Critical Server Group, and the outstanding sales teams!\n\nOur other largest wins this month were:\nAlcatel Telecom (France) - $60M global upgrade for billing system based on\nAlphaServers running Tru64 UNIX-based NECTAR middleware.

It states simplification, a\ncustomer-centric approach, information access products and a clarified\nchannel strategy are keys to Compaq's comeback.  Preliminary 2Q market share\nfigures from IDC also confirm our progress in a number of other key areas.\nFor example:\n * Compaq led the WW PC server market with 30.2%, more than the\nNo. 2 (Dell) and No. 3 (IBM) vendors combined\n * We ranked second in WW portables, with 12.8%, up 2.2 points\nQ/Q\n * In Japan, we moved up to No. 7 position, past Apple, in\ntotal PCs, and regained our No. 2 server position from Fujitsu-Siemens, with\na 13.5% share\n * In Asia Pacific, we passed HP in desktops, moving up to No.\n4\n * And according to DataQuest, EMEA achieved the No. 1 Consumer\nranking in Western Europe with a 13.4% share, growing twice as fast as the\nmarket\nFor more information about the preliminary market share results of 2Q, or\nour final results in 1Q, check the links at\n<http://inline.compaq.com/wwss/facts.asp>\n\nWinning news from Global Accounts\nOur Global Accounts team not only wins new business, but also accolades for\nits videos and CDs that are used to help win business.  Trophies include two\nat the AXIEM (Absolute Excellence in Electronic Media) Awards in the U.S.,\nand the Telly Awards for non-network broadcasts, comparable to a U.S. TV\nshow winning an Emmy.\n<http://newscpq1.inline.cpqcorp.net/article.cfm?storyid=968>\n\nService Provider/.com wins\nData Return, a leading global provider of advanced managed hosting services,\nwas recognized by Microsoft as \"Global Hosting Partner of the Year\" during\nthe Fusion 2000 Awards Banquet. The award noted Data Return's ongoing work\nwith the Windows 2000 team in developing managed hosting solutions for\ncustomers whose applications are based on the Microsoft platform. This\nrepresents a tremendous win for Compaq as well, since Data Return is using\nCompaq hardware and services exclusively for its hosting services.\n\nOn July 31st, Compaq, Microsoft, Digex and IDC launched a series of Webcasts\nto help educate Compaq Field Sales and the Compaq/Microsoft Channel. The\nseries, presented by a top IDC analyst, emphasized the tremendous market\nopportunity within the ASP market. Based on the overwhelming participation\nand positive feedback, there is a strong interest in learning more about the\nASP market. The second in the series will be presented September 7. To\nregister, call 800-289-0579 (outside US 719-457-2550).\n\nCoconut.com, an ASP in the UK initially offering mail and messaging, has\nnamed Compaq its key partner.  The solution, heavily leveraged around our\nProfessional Services capability, is Alpha and StorageWorks running\nSoftware.com's suite of carrier-grade mail and messaging products.  The\ninfrastructure will be managed by eBMS.  HP had been working on this for 18\nmonths, and Compaq got engaged the day before they were about to sign the\ndeal.  Seven weeks later HP was told they had lost the opportunity.  The key\nto our success was a partnering approach to help them with their business,\nnot just to sell them tin.  The near-term opportunity is $5M, with up to\n$25M over 5 years.  Congratulations to the UK team!\n\nGreat Compaq Financial Services deals\nSupply Access - CFS is providing a $6.5M financing facility on Alpha and NT\nservers for this service provider, owned by En Point, one of Compaq's\nlargest resellers in California.  The deal, which displaced HP and HP\nFinance, includes a two-year exclusivity agreement.\n\nAvantel - CFS also completed a $3.5M deal to refresh the installed base of\nAvantel's existing Compaq desktops and servers in Mexico.  While Avantel is\na longtime Compaq customer, the inclusion of Compaq Financial Services\nenabled a complex sale and lease back arrangement for the acquisition of\nCompaq equipment, with opportunities for ongoing contact with the customer.\n\nRoundup of Storage news\nAs you may have noticed from the earnings news, the Storage Product Group\nhad a strong Q2, with profitability of $179M, up 45% from last year.  SPG\ndelivered 11.8% of Compaq's net sales, 17.8% of total gross margin, and a\nwhopping 31.6 % of Compaq's operating income. Other news from the Storage\nfront includes:\n * A SANworks print ad campaign, directed at corporate CIOs,\nstarted on July 10th and will be running for several weeks. The ads direct\ncustomers to a Web companion page for more information, go to\n<http://www.compaq.com/sanworks>.\n * On August 22, Compaq will open a new Enterprise Storage\nCustomer Center (ESCC) in Colorado Springs, Colo., that will develop and\nqualify advanced network storage technologies for complex enterprise\nenvironments and offer training for IT professionals. The Center will\ncomplement the new Storage Networking Technology Center that was announced\nearlier this spring by the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA)\nand is currently being constructed by Compaq.  Both centers will be housed\nunder one roof when the SNIA center opens later this year.\n * The Storage Networks Solutions Business Unit, focused on\nproviding leading-edge solutions to the industry, has created a Business\nDevelopment Team. For more information, contact Frank Orlando, who leads the\nteam.\n\nZero Latency and other BCSG attention-getters\nWhat debuted 10 months ago at Telecom99 as a riveting demonstration of\nCompaq's first Zero Latency Enterprise (ZLE) technology has matured into a\nformal go-to-market program that will be launched and rolled out in October.\nIts goal?  To help you identify ZLE opportunities and win deals.  The\nBusiness Critical Server Group (BCSG) has established the ZLE Initiative to\nencompass all of our enterprise offerings - Himalaya; AlphaServer with Tru64\nUnix and OpenVMS; and ProLiant with Windows NT, as well as storage, clients\nand services.  It will differentiate Compaq in the marketplace, generate\nmomentum for the company, and give us \"first-to-market\" status.  No other\ncompetitor can come close to what we offer.  The typical ZLE deal profile is\nhigh-revenue - $15M per deal - and high-margin, so the payoff is great.\nStay tuned for announcements in October, including info on ZLE customers;\ncool new offerings incorporating platforms, partners and services; new\ndemos; go-to-market tools to help you tell the ZLE story; ZLE expertise to\nassist with your accounts; and press and analyst proof points to help you\nsell.  I encourage you to learn more about ZLE so you can leverage its\nrevenue potential.  For more information, contact your BCSG region drivers.\n\nOther highlights from BCSG:\n * Congratulations to the Tandem BU for its Q2 performance, the\nsecond highest in revenue for the BU in Compaq history.  In addition, the\nS74 series had the fastest ramp in the history of the Himalaya platform,\nwith $69M in S74000 processors shipped since its May launch.\n * MUZO, a Czech payment authorization agency and long-time\ncustomer, will migrate to the most powerful of the Himalaya servers, the\nS74000, for its new authorization center opening in 1Q01.  MUZO provides\nATM/POS authorization and back-office services using Base24 from partner\nACI.  The order is important for Compaq in the Czech Republic because it\npositions the platform firmly in the country and demonstrates the success of\nthe ongoing efforts of the Czech subsidiary to build local Himalaya\nresources and skills.\n * The \"Dream Machine\" roadshow, which showcases the\nAlphaServer GS160 server running OpenVMS Galaxy, is starting its North\nAmerican tour. One of its first stops was in Boston in late July, where it\nreceived an enthusiastic response from the Compaq Board of Directors.\n * Recently named a partner for Oracle's iHost applications\nhosting initiative, Nupremis is the first service provider to announce that\nit will host Oracle iHost applications on AlphaServers running Tru64 UNIX in\nits data centers to provide the most scalable and highly available platform\nfor e-business.\n\nGreat things happening in the Consumer world\n* In 1Q, Compaq surpassed Packard Bell as the US installed base market\nshare leader for the first time, according to Media Metrix.  The number of\nCompaq PCs in US homes has increased 260% to 5.4 million from 1997 through\n1Q.\n* Presario portable PCs maintained their No. 1 U.S. retail sales share\nin June for the 22nd consecutive month, according to NPD Intelect\n* The Presario 1200XL-110 was rated a Best Buy and No. 1 Budget\nnotebook by PC World magazine\n* The Presario 1800T was rated the No. 5 Power notebook by PC World\nmagazine\n* Compaq's 2Q consumer PC sales in Malaysia were up over 1,200%, due\nlargely to Compaq's kiosk strategy there.  The kiosks have been successful\nenough to be featured in the Far East Economic Review\n* Compaq beat out four other PC manufacturers to partner with\nspecialty retailer Eddie Bauer on special edition Presario 1400 series\nportable PCs\n\nJoint news from Consumer and CPCG\nBy now I'm sure you've read about the exciting new additions to the iPAQ\nfamily of products and services, announced jointly by Mike Larson and Mike\nWinkler in New York on August 15.  The announcement symbolizes the growing\nconvergence of the commercial and consumer markets, and the mutual desire\nfor information and Internet access by our customers.\n\nIn addition, CPCG deserves special congratulations on their outstanding 2Q\nresults - returning to profitability one quarter ahead of what was expected!\nAll regions were profitable, contributing to the total $63M in operating\nprofit.  The group achieved the best portable shipment quarter on record,\nshipped the 100,000th iPAQ desktop, and the iPAQ Pocket PC demand is 10\ntimes the initial forecast!  And by the looks of all the commercial products\nwins listed in this report, the momentum is continuing.  For an interesting\nQ&A by CNET News.com with Mike Winkler on the group's achievement, see:\n<http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-201-2375731-0.html>\n\nNew ISSG product announcements and recognition\nISSG has been busy with a lot of new product announcements, including the\nindustry's first high-performance network attached server appliance, the\nTaskSmart N-Series, new clustering solutions for SCO, Oracle and Microsoft.\nMore news includes:\n * The ProLiant 8500 is now Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 Best Performance\non the TPC-C top 10 list.  The Compaq Benchmarks result in a Price/tpmC that\nis approximately $10 lower than the top marking IBM number and is using SQL\nServer 2000 instead of DB2.  We even pushed the Sun 10000 off the top 10\nlist.\nCheck out the great review and double awards for the ProLiant DL360 by\nInternetWeek Magazine, titled, \"Rack 'Em Up.\"\n<http://www.internetwk.com/reviews00/rev071700.htm>\n\nCompaq dominates Commerce One's Global Trading Web portals\nNot only do we power C1's own MarketSite.net U.S. portal and all its hosted\ninstallations, but we also power an overwhelming number of its major portal\npartners.  These include NTT in Japan, which recently replaced its 30 Dell\nservers with Compaq, and Cable and Wireless (Optus) in Australia, that,\nafter major firmware problems with Dell, is also switching to Compaq.  Let's\nbe bold about stating our dominance in this market - especially when\npitching prospective business with other trading exchanges.  I'm sure\nMichael Capellas won't hold back when keynoting at C1's eLink Conference in\nLas Vegas next month where we'll demo our Hosting Internet Buying Program\nand BuySite and MarketSiteTM solutions.\n\nNA eBusiness Solutions update\n * Great response since the launch of the speedStart Program,\nwhich provides Web-based resources to start-up dotcoms - 281 companies have\nregistered, 71 have submitted applications to join the program, and 56 have\napplied for leasing financing.\n * The Microsoft/Compaq dotcom roadshows yielded 6,000\ncustomers in 15 cities with 2,533 leads generated - 41% of all attendees ...\n222 qualified leads passed onto sales teams or partners.  98% of attendees\nrated the roadshows as \"met/exceeded expectations.\"\n * The NA Retail Industry Marketing team driving the ACTIVE\nKIOSK Initiative has developed a $140M pipeline in the emerging kiosk market\nover the past two quarters.

  "text": "Thanks so much for your most generous gift to complete the funding for the\nprofessorship honoring Pinkney Walker.  I'm delighted that you plan to\nattend the Davenport Society banquet on October 13.\n\nThe purpose of this e-mail, which Rosalee suggested as the most efficient\nway of reaching you, is two-fold:\n\n     1. To seek your endorsement of naming the new professorship the Pinkney\nC. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship.  Rather than designating the\nprofessorship for Business and Economics, for Business Theory, or for some\nother area, I'd like to use it to recognize and reward a faculty member in\nthe College of Business who is especially known for teaching effectiveness.\nBoth Bob Pugh and Ralph Clark endorse this approach; I have a call into\nHarold Hook to seek his input.\n\nA few points of elaboration:\n     * \"Distinguished\" is a standard adjective in the titles of such\npositions.\n     * We will use a committee of faculty and administrators within the\ncollege to select the recipient of the professorship, subject to my\napproval.\n     * And, I don't know if we will have the recipient selected by October\n13.\n\nThis name for the professorship (1) coincides with Pinkney's great strength,\n(2) allows me to avoid any \"turf battles\" (either within the college or with\nEconomics) and (3) underscores the great importance of teaching in the\ncollege.  Please let me know whether you are agreeable to this name.\n\n     2. To ask you to serve as the keynote speaker for the Davenport Society\nbanquet on October 13.  We would be honored if you would present a brief\ntalk (perhaps 10 minutes in length) related to some aspect of the future of\nbusiness.  Your doing so would certainly add luster to an always festive\nevent.  By way of brief background, Jack and Mary Bush, MU alumni who now\nlive in Dallas and are co-chairs of the Davenport Society this year, have\nchosen the future of business as the theme for the banquet and program.\nYour talk would come after dinner and could be preceded or followed\n(probably followed) by the announcement of the Pinkney Walker Professorship.\nI understand from Rosalee that you will be giving a talk in Austin the\nmorning of October 13; perhaps an abridged version of it would be suitable\nfor the Davenport Society banquet.  Of course, you have great latitude in\nchoosing the topic you would like to address.  Please let me know if you\nwill serve as the keynote speaker.\n\nIf you can give me quick responses to these 2 requests, we will complete the\nplans for the evening, which will include the annoucement of the Pinkney\nWalker Professorship and, I hope, a keynote address by you.  Naturally, if\nyou have questions, either you or Rosalee can call me.  My office # is\n573/882-6688, and my home # is 573/875-2972.\n\nLet me close by mentioning that there was some question as to whether or not\nPinkney would attend the banquet on October 13.  Apparently he had/has been\nexperiencing some health problems.  However, the latest I've heard is that\nhe intends to attend, due in large part to your commitment to be there.\nTime permitting, you might want to give him a quick call to tell him you'll\nsee him here in Columbia on October 13.  (By the way, if Pinkney and his\nwife arrive on October 12, I will invite them to attend an informal dinner I\nwill host that evening for members of the college's advisory board.  Of\ncourse, you are invited to attend the dinner on October 12 as well, but it's\nmy understanding that you will fly to Columbia on October 13.)\n\nKen, thanks very much.  I hope and trust that you had an ample dose of \"R&R\"\nduring your vacation.  I look forward to hearing from you.",

  "text": "I wanted to make sure you were aware of something that has come up since\nthe last breakfast meeting regarding our group financing the Arena parking\ngarage.  Baker & Botts put us in touch with the Rockets to discuss Hines\nbeing the Development Manager on the Arena and garage.  Although not fully\nagreed, there is strong interest on both sides.  Besides help on the\ndevelopment front, we think there may be value in our acting as a bit of a\nbuffer between the Sports Authority and the Rockets and coordinating any\nissues involving the new convention hotel(where we are also providing\ndevelopment management).  The Rockets(Mike Goldberg-Baker & Botts) have\ntalked to Ric Campo and supposedly he is enthusiastic but thinks this\nshould \"be the Authority's idea.\".  One issue is how much of our fee would\napply to the garage, which presumably the city would pick up, and how much\nwould apply to the Arena.  Since this is a fast moving issue, I wanted you\nto know about this. Obviously the discussions are all very confidential.\nIf you have any thoughts in advance of the next breakfast meeting, please\ngive me a call at 713-966-2606.\n\nAlso, on another topic, we have been doing a tiny bit of pie in the sky\nbrainstorming on the concept of creating some kind of Futures/Options\nmarket in the commercial space market.  I will approach Jeff Skilling\nunless you would recommend elsewhere within Enron.",

August 29, 2000 -- Scott Hodge has been named executive\ndirector of the Tax Foundation. Most recently he has worked as director of\ntax and budget policy at Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation and is\nrecognized as one of Washington's leading experts on the federal budget. He\nhas been widely published on fiscal policy, notably in the pages of The Wall\nStreet Journal, The Washington Post, USA Today, and The Washington Times.\nHis work as Senior Budget Analyst at the Heritage Foundation included the\nediting of three books on the federal budget. Mr. Hodge has been a\ncommentator on nightly news shows such as NBC Nightly News and CBS Nightly\nNews, and has been seen regularly on CNN, Fox Network, and C-SPAN.\nAt the same time, Patrick Fleenor has been named the Foundation's chief\neconomist.

  "text": "The Supreme Court hearing for the case in India regarding the alleged \nimproper bidding and award of the Panna/Mukta block concluded today.  Our \nlegal team's opinion is very optimistic based on the way the proceeding \nprogressed and also on the actions of the chief judge during the concluding \narguments of the case today in India. \n\nThe panel of three judges will now take approximately 2 months to write their \nopinion and that should complete this case.  While I probably shouldn't  \nspeculate on the outcome, I will summarize my opinion of the important \npoints:  1) there is little doubt that the Panna/Mukta award to \nEnron/Reliance/ONGC will stand, and  2) it is highly unlikely that the judges \nwill request the PSC to be renegotiated, the contract was portrayed and \ngenerally accepted by the panel as a very fair deal for the GOI.  According \nto my general counsel, Stephen Wallace, the only concern our team has is that \nthe judges were quite critical of the CBI (the government group that \ninvestigated Reliance for wrong doing in the bid process) during that portion \nof the testimony and there is a possibility that they could request an \nadditional investigation.  Our team puts the likelihood of the judges \nordering a new investigation at less than 50%.  There is downside to such a \ndecision in that it creates uncertainty, but the focus would be on Reliance, \nnot Enron. \n\nEnron was very prepared on the commercial and the legal front and our team, \nas expected, carried the load for this case even though we were not the \nprimary defendants.  Enron presented the major rebuttal to the CPIL \nassertions because the others were not prepared and then later \"coached\" the \nothers to help them prepare appropriately.   This was a much more intensive \ncase than people were assuming it would be last year and we were very \nfortunate to be extremely well prepared and well represented.   \n\nBased on the above information,  I do not think this issue \"CPIL lawsuit\"  \nshould  impact any future decisions we make regarding the Panna/ Mukta/Tapti \nassets.  This outcome basically eliminates one of the two issues impeding the \nprogress of  the  project I showed Joe, our proposal to sell \nPanna/Mukta/Tapti, that we call Project Janus.  We believe we have a unique \nopportunity to realize exceptional value for these assets through an \narrangement with our partner.  The strategy we have mapped out should  allow \nus to close the transaction prior to year-end and it has very positive cash \nflow and neutral financial implications (minimal if any gain due to the \nstep-up last year) for the company.   The only remaining hurdle is a tax \nissue that we are currently working. \n\njeff",

Lay \nChairman & C.E.O. \nEnron Corporation \n\nDear Dr. Lay: \n\nI am writing to bring your attention to an important and timely event that \nwill be held on September 20th at the Hyatt Regency Columbus, in Columbus, \nOhio - \"The Governors' Natural Gas Summit: Responding to the Challenge.\" This \nevent is convened by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC).? \nCo-chaired by Alaska Governor Tony Knowles, IOGCC Chairman and Ohio Governor \nBob Taft, with the participation of other governors, this forum promises to \nbe an outstanding exchange of ideas among leaders of government, energy \nproducers, transporters, distributors, and end-users on the subject of the \ncurrent and long-term outlook for natural gas resources and markets in North \nAmerica. A very distinguished group of speakers is assembling, including \nsenior government officials and senior executives of companies critically \ninvolved in the energy value chain.\n\nPrimary Goals of the Summit include: \n\n* Exploring and clearly communicating the current dynamics of the natural gas \nmarket \n* Informing the industry and the public about the current and future supply \npotential for gas \n* Providing governmental and industry leaders with an opportunity to discuss \nnatural gas in the context of national energy policy, with the input of \ninterested State Governors.\n\nThe Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC) and the governors have \nasked CERA to help organize the Summit and has invited senior CERA staff to \nmoderate panel discussions on the Natural Gas Marketplace and the Supply \nResponse for North America. In addition, I will be providing an opening \nframework for participants and contributing to the wrap-up of the Summit at \nthe close of the day with the governors.? We are very pleased to be working \nwith the governors and with the IOGCC and its executive director, Christine \nHansen.\n\nWe hope that you can join us for this important event, and encourage you to \nview the Summit agenda on the IOGCC Web-site at: \nhttp://www.iogcc.state.ok.us/MEETINGS/2000_Governors_Natural_Gas_Summit.htm? \n\nOn this site, you will also find complete registration information including \nfees, registration form, and logistics. \n\nYou may also be interested in a recent Washington Post article on volatility \nin the gas and power markets, which helps provide a context for the \ndiscussion and which was co-authored by CERA Managing Director Tom Robinson \nand myself. This article may be found on the Washington Post Web-site at: \nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A18653-2000Jul20.html \n\nShould you have any questions regarding the Summit or CERA's participation, \nplease contact my colleague Ron Kapavik at +1 936 931 1416 or via e-mail to \nrkapavik@cera.com.\n\nSincerely, \n\nDan Yergin \nChairman, Cambridge Energy Research Associates \n\n**************************************************************** \nOur relationship with you is very important to us.?

This patent represents an idea, without any \nexhaustive quantitative analysis or research and without any prototype \ndemonstrated in the field or a lab.\n\nWe politely told Mr. Hatchett that we would review his proposal and get back \nto him.\n\nSubsequently, we conveyed to Mr. Hatchett that a) methane consumption rate \nfor an integrated facility based on the subject patent is higher than the \nconventional plant efficiency b) the result in fuel cost is higher c) the \noverall Co2 emissions are probably higher d) there is no economical or \ntechnical justification to support an investment of Enron funds.  \n\nWe informed Bob Hatchett that we would recommend to Enron that Enron not \ninvest in the development of this effort.

Joe\n---------------------- Forwarded by Joseph W Sutton/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on \n09/01/2000 09:13 AM ---------------------------\n   \n\tEnron International\n\t\n\tFrom:  John Hardy                           08/31/2000 03:57 PM\n\t\n\nTo: Joseph W Sutton/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT\ncc:  \nSubject: Azurix and OPIC\n\nJoe\n I want to give you a heads up on a serious issue that has developed between \nAzurix and OPIC. There is no action requested from you but I wanted you to be \naware of this development.\n\n Last spring we encouraged Azurix to look to OPIC and IDB for funding support \nfor the financing needed for their Argentinian concession for the province of \nBuenos Aires.  For the past several months teams from Azurix and the two \nlending agencies have been moving forward with the expectation that we could \ngo to an OPIC Board vote in September for $100 million and to the IDB Board \nin October for $150 million.\n\n Everything was going along great until last friday.  Early last week OPIC \nhad its credit committee review and approve the project, though apparently \nsome members were concerned about the regulatory risk associated with water \nprojects. (This would be OPIC's first financing of a water project.)   Friday \nAM, George Munoz recieved a draft cable from the US Embassy in Argentina \nproviding their assessment of the project and, on the spot, pulled the \nproject from Investment Committee and off the calendar for consideration by \nthe OPIC Board in September.  Friday afternoon, OPIC staff informed Azurix \nand our office in a meeting that Azurix should be resorting to \"Plan B\", \nimplying that the project would not go forward in the foreseeable future.  \nOPIC would not provide Azurix or us with the cable. \n\n Over the weekend, the cable was formally sent to Washington, though now \nreclassified as a classified document so we have not been able to see its \ncontents.  Moreover, the Ambassador has specifically conveyed his directive \nto Washington that the cable is not to be shown to anyone outside of the \ngovernment,   John Garrison has a relationship with the Ambassador but has \nnot been able to get the Embassy to alter its position, nor would I think \nthey be inclined to do so now given the fact that they could have \ndisassociated themselves from the draft on friday but did not.\n\n On the positive side, the InterAmerican Development Bank has stated that \nthey are prepared to consider increasing the size of the B loan to cover the \nadditional $100 million.   We have met with the IDB and discussed the \nsituation at OPIC; they seem satisfied at this point.\n\n It appears to me that George Munoz is unwilling to take to the Board the \nAzurix project when a damning cable has been circulated around the government \neven if the substance of the cable is exaggerated, taken out of context and \ndistorted.  From what we have learned, the cable containes concerns expressed \nabout the regulatroy framework, labor issues etc., etc., but also comments \nfrom the Argentinian goverment about Azurix and the concession about Bahia \nBlanca and the politics of Azurix in Argentina. It is uncompromisingly \nnegative in its tone.\n\n Azurix is seeking a return of  the $250,000 fee and will withdraw its \napplication.\n\n Hope all is well.  John\n\n\n\n       \n",

While it is quite a departure from the traditional \nconference agenda, I think it will prove to be engaging and \nthought-provoking.  I'll look forward to your input.\n\nIf you are comfortable with the agenda, I'd like to send a copy of it to the \nExecutive Committee accompanied by a memo from the Office of the Chairman \nexplaining the goals and objectives for the conference.  It is important that \nsenior management understand the change in format and their role, if any, on \nthe agenda.  (I recognize that some executives look forward to presenting at \nthis conference and their absence from the agenda may be an issue for them.)\n\nI am working with some talented people to create a slide template for all \npresenters.  We're also asking that all presenters use PowerPoint.  A \nstandardized template and format will ensure that all the presentations, even \nthose from external presenters, have a similar look and feel.   I'll run that \ntemplate by you as soon as it is finalized.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions, comments or concerns.\n\n\n\n",

This is not typical of the way we should\nnow work and we have made changes to account management and service\nrepresentation.\n\nWe have made enormous progress as a Corporation over the last twelve months.\nThere is a lot of good news in many accounts around the world but there is\nalso no complacency and it concerns me a great deal when we have less than\nperfect execution.\n\nI shall be following up with Philippe and the account team to ensure we do a\ngreat job in the future.\n\nRegards\nPeter\n\n\n>  -----Original Message-----\n> From:  Capellas, Michael D.\n> Sent: Friday, August 25, 2000 8:13 AM\n> To: 'klay@enron.com'\n> Cc: Blackmore, Peter\n> Subject: Disappointing news\n>\n> Ken:\n>\n> Very shortly after we spoke, I was informed that we had lost the Enron\n> HomePC Program.

Besides help on the\ndevelopment front, we think there may be value in our acting as a bit of a\nbuffer between the Sports Authority and the Rockets and coordinating any\nissues involving the new convention hotel(where we are also providing\ndevelopment management).  The Rockets(Mike Goldberg-Baker & Botts) have\ntalked to Ric Campo and supposedly he is enthusiastic but thinks this\nshould \"be the Authority's idea.\".  One issue is how much of our fee would\napply to the garage, which presumably the city would pick up, and how much\nwould apply to the Arena.  Since this is a fast moving issue, I wanted you\nto know about this. Obviously the discussions are all very confidential.\nIf you have any thoughts in advance of the next breakfast meeting, please\ngive me a call at 713-966-2606.\n\nAlso, on another topic, we have been doing a tiny bit of pie in the sky\nbrainstorming on the concept of creating some kind of Futures/Options\nmarket in the commercial space market.  I will approach Jeff Skilling\nunless you would recommend elsewhere within Enron.\n\n\n",

He is now chairman of the AIP\nCertification and Accreditation Council.\n\nThe energy industry, though cautious about utilizing the web, is scrambling\nto take advantage of this next big thing.  Recently, several top companies\nhave taken the plunge to hire Internet professionals to develop their own\nvirtual training programs.\n\nEquiva Services LLC, a joint venture company formed by Texaco Inc., Shell\nOil Company and Saudi Refining, Inc, ABB Vetco Gray, and Columbia Gulf\nTransmission Company, have all recently jumped on the e-learning bandwagon.\nAll three companies have created web-based platforms or e-commerce hubs tha=\nt\nenable employees to quickly and conveniently get necessary training from\npre-selected suppliers.\n\n=01&This type of innovative application of information technology will help=\n us\nto work smarter and faster for our internal clients,=018 said Mari Duarte,\nsenior human resources generalist for ABB Vetco Gray.  =01&We expect to low=\ner\ncosts and improve efficiency by reducing the time of administrative\ntransactions related to registration and by improving reporting of\ninformation related to training activities to management.=018\n\nFor the energy industry, E-learning can involve both the automation of\ntraining management systems as well as the transmission and delivery of\nlearning to individuals through use of the Internet.  Through this\ntechnology, training information previously available through classroom\ninstruction can be delivered directly to employees=01, desktops in differen=\nt\nforms, ranging from basic presentation-style courses to highly interactive\ncourses with digitized video transmissions and on-line discussions.\n\n=01&E-learning can encompass training employees and it can be used to share\nimportant knowledge across the organization and with outside business\npartners,=018 said Dennis McMullin, energy industry consultant at Proxicom,=\n a\nleading Internet consulting firm in Houston, Texas.  McMullin says that mor=\ne\ncompanies are increasing the amount of training they offer online to help\nemployees stay current on market trends and personal skills.  =01&There can=\n be\na significant cost savings involved in using technology for learning, but a\ncompany=01,s success ultimately depends on how effectively it can bring the\ntechnology into the organization and how well they use it.=018\n\nE-learning technology can also ease the administrative burden on an\norganization=01,s human resources department and lower the per-unit cost of\ntraining employees.  Additionally, management has the ability to better\nanalyze training needs and how to best deploy the information.  =01&Web-bas=\ned\ntraining is extremely flexible and offers employees convenience in\nscheduling courses when they need and want them,=018 said McMullin.  =01&It=\n also\nallows them the opportunity to go back and revisit course material if the\nneed a refresher or a resource.  It is a self-teaching method that lets\nindividuals learn at their own pace and based on their own needs.\"\n\nInternet companies such as VerticalNet, Inc. in Horsham, PA, offer companie=\ns\nthe ability to manage training programs through an Internet interface that\ndirectly links the company with training suppliers.  Taken one stop further=\n,\nVerticalNet=01,s =01&Training Intelligence Portals=018 enable companies to =\ncentralize\ntheir personnel training programs and literally outsource administration an=\nd\nother back-office transactions such as invoice management, utilization\nreporting, course evaluation and quality assurance.\n\nAccording to Walter Rogers, VerticalNet=01,s eBusiness training services se=\nnior\ndirector and general manager, the energy industry is becoming more\naggressive in moving from office administration and classroom learning to\nweb-based technology for training.  =01&We=01,re seeing a lot more demand f=\nrom the\nenergy sector for e-learning technology,=018 said Rogers, whose firm is\ncurrently working with several large energy companies.  =01&We=01,ve found =\nthat\nthe energy industry doesn=01,t typically lead the way in the use of technol=\nogy.\nIt tends to want to see it working and proven in other areas before they tr=\ny\nit.  But now they are getting more involved.  Since the industry is driven\nto reduce operating costs, it finds this technology to be very cost\neffective.=018\n\nIn addition to hiring Internet experts to develop and manage a training\nsite, Dennis McMullin points out that there is a large variety of existing\ntraining opportunities for on-line learning.  =01&Most of the technology\ncompanies offer on-line training for technical products, while numerous web\nsites offer free information and opportunities for e-learning,=018 he said.\n\nIn the end, however, McMullin believes that acceptance of the Internet is\nmore than a technological issue for many companies, rather it requires a\ncultural adjustment.  =01&It really is an issue of adjusting the company\nculture to accept and benefit from Internet technology.  It requires\ncompanies to be more open and less fearful of sharing information.  Energy\ncompanies could really benefit from effective use of the Internet if they\nuse it as a median to share more knowledge throughout their organizations\nand with suppliers.=018\n\n\n\nNEWS ROUND-UP\n\n\nDUKE SOLUTIONS USING B2B MARKETPLACE TO REDUCE CLIENT BILLS\n<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml>#news1\n\nTS HUB: A NEW OFFERING FROM FT ENERGY\n <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#news2>\n\nGE POWER SYSTEMS ANNOUNCES OFFER TO ACQUIRE SMALLWORLD PLC\n<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#news3>\n\nOPENLINK EXPANDS EUROPEAN OPERATIONS\n<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#news4>\n\nPARKER DRILLING CONSIDERS INTERNET OPPORTUNITIES\n<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#news5>\n\nPOWERTRUST.COM APPOINTS CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER\n<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#news6>\n\n******************************************************\nAdvertisement\n\nE-BUSINESS FOR ENERGY ASIA PACIFIC\nOctober 7-9, 2000  Singapore\nLearn how the e-business explosion is changing the Asian Pacific energy\nsector\nhttp://www.eyeforenergy.com/asia-pacific\n\nINTRANET AND PORTAL STRATEGIES FOR ENERGY\nOctober 17-19, 2000  Houston, TX\nThe premier annual US forum on internal e-business strategies for the entir=\ne\nenergy industry\n<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/ipse>\n\n*******************************************************\n\nCASE STUDY\n\nSpare plant parts become manageable with Sparesfinder.com\n\nOne of the Internet=01,s most powerful features is its ability to make\ninformation instantly available that once was virtually impossible to get.\nThat=01,s exactly the power behind sparesFinder.com, an Internet service th=\nat\nallows chemical, petroleum and power companies to manage their own\ninventories of factory parts and search the inventories of other companies\naround the globe for needed replacements.\n\nClick here for full article:\n<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#case1>\n\n\nCASE STUDY\n\nDeregulation and the Consumer\n\nConventional wisdom tells us to =01&build it and they will come.=018 With o=\nver\n$300 billion at stake in the U.S. energy market alone, it is not surprising\nthat the young-guns of the Internet world are homing in on the traditional\nlegacy laden utilities as deregulation tears away at their regional\nmonopolies.\n\nClick here for full article:\n<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#case2>\n\n\nRELATED INDUSTRY FEATURES\n<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#related>\n\nREDMETEOR.COM CHOOSE SAGAVISTA FOR BACKEND INTEGRATION SOLUTION\n <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#related1>\nTRADIANT TEAMS WITH ANDERSEN CONSULTING TO BRING THE POWER OF THE WEB TO\nGLOBAL SHIPPING INDUSTRY\n<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#related2>\n\n*******************************************************\n\nTo subscribe for the e-commerce for energy briefing\nEmail   : energynews-subscribe-request@peach.ease.lsoft.com\n<mailto:energynews-subscribe-request@peach.ease.lsoft.com>\n\nTo unsubscribe,\nEmail  energynews-signoff-request@peach.ease.lsoft.com\n<mailto:energynews-signoff-request@peach.ease.lsoft.com>\n\nTo comment on this newsletter or add your own content please\nEmail Michelle at ecenergy@firstconf.com\n\n******************************************************\n\ne-business for energy briefing\nWednesday September 6 2000\nIssue 10\n\n*******************************************************\nDisclaimer - First Conferences and its agents used their best efforts in\ncollecting and preparing the information published herein.

Generex will also receive royalty payments based\n\non product sales.  In exchange, Lilly will receive exclusive worldwide\n\nrights to products resulting from the collaboration.  Lilly will be\n\nresponsible for conducting clinical trials, securing regulatory approvals\n\nand marketing on a worldwide basis.  Clinical trials of the first product\n\ncandidate are under way in North America and Europe.  Lilly will also have\n\nthe option to develop a number of additional products depending on the\n\nsuccess of the initial product.\n\n\n\n\"We look forward to working with Generex, whose buccal spray delivery\n\ntechnology potentially represents a novel approach to drug delivery,\" said\n\nJames A. Harper, president, diabetes and growth disorders products for\n\nLilly. \"A buccal spray formulation of insulin could provide an attractive\n\nalternative for people with diabetes.\"\n\n\n\n\"The opportunity to partner with Lilly, the global leader in insulins, to\n\ndevelop the world's first marketed buccal insulin spray represents very\n\ngood news for millions of patients with diabetes throughout the world,\"\n\nsaid Anna Gluskin, chief executive officer of Generex. \"We are pleased that\n\nLilly has recognized the potential of buccal delivery of insulin and\n\nGenerex's RapidMist? technology for systemic delivery of proteins, peptides\n\nand other large molecule drugs.\"\n\n\n\nToday, worldwide costs for treating diabetes and its complications are\n\nestimated to exceed $200 billion annually.  It is also estimated that, over\n\nthe next decade, the number of people with this disease will more than\n\ndouble.  Lilly has been a leader in diabetes care for more than 75 years.\n\nThe company continues to aggressively pursue the goal of being a complete\n\ndiabetes care company and intends to provide innovative products to treat\n\nall types and stages of diabetes.\n\n\n\nGenerex is engaged in the research and development of drug delivery systems\n\nand technologies. To date, it has focused on developing a platform\n\ntechnology for the buccal delivery (absorption through the inner cheek\n\nwalls) of large molecule drugs which, historically, have been administered\n\nonly by injection. Additional information about Generex can be found at\n\nwww.generex.com.\n\n\n\nLilly, a leading innovation-driven corporation, is developing a growing\n\nportfolio of best-in-class pharmaceutical products by applying the latest\n\nresearch from its own worldwide laboratories and from collaborations with\n\neminent scientific organizations. Headquartered in Indianapolis, Ind.,\n\nLilly provides answers ? through medicines and information ? for some of\n\nthe world's most urgent medical needs.\n\n\n\nCertain statements set forth above may constitute forward-looking\nstatements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform\nAct of 1995. Although Generex and Lilly believe that such statements are\nbased on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of their knowledge of\ntheir business and operations, there can be no assurance that: (i) Lilly or\nGenerex will not terminate the collaboration, (ii) that any products will\nbe developed, manufactured or commercialized successfully, or (iii) that\nsignificant funding will be received by Generex as a result of this\ncollaboration.\n\nEach company's business is subject to significant risks and there can be no\nassurance that actual results of the companies' development activities and\nresults of their operations will not differ materially from expectations.\nFor information with respect to other factors, which could cause actual\nresults to differ from expectations, reference is made to the 10-K and 10-Q\nreports filed by Generex and Lilly, respectively, with the Securities and\nExchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\n\n                                #    #    #\n\n\n\n",

Do you\nremember that incident??? Kenny and I still\nremember! The reason for the message is that I\nwanted to send you the address of  LFGA which is\nas follows:\nhttp://www.geocities.com/heartland/acres/8896/index.html\n       You should look at Line #4 which is our\nline of the Lay family. Turn your speakers on\ncause you will hear some music. I am now the\nPresident of this organization so I am trying to\nget my all of my line to pay some attention to\ntheir lineage.

  "text": "This afternoon, officials from Delta Airlines came in to meet with me to\ngive formal notice that they will be ceasing service from Portland to Narita\nand Nagoya Japan, as well as several other US cities as of April 1, 2001.\nThey will have 15 flights a day to 5 cities, down from 24 flights a day to\n12 cities.  Included in the cut list are flights to San Francisco, Las\nVegas, Los Angeles, and New York.  Following is the statement I am releasing\nto the media today about my disappointment about the situation this leaves\nus in and my plans to look for alternate carriers.\n\nTo be removed from the \"E-Katz\" distribution list, simply reply to this\ne-mail with your request.  If you have multiple e-mail addresses you use,\nplease include a name and/or company, otherwise we may not be able to locate\nthe correct entry to remove.  For more information on the Katz\nadministration, visit our website at http://www.ci.portland.or.us/mayor.\n\n\n\n\"I am very disappointed by today's announcement.  This is a big loss for\nPortland, and it will have a lasting effect on our economy.\n\n\"Perhaps because of the current strong economy, Portlanders have\nconsistently rated efforts to 'grow as an international city' lowest on\ntheir list of priorities.  Still, as Mayor I worked long and hard with Delta\nover the last ten years and fought for their routes to Osaka and Fukuoka,\nbecause I felt strongly that Portland's future was in being an international\ncity.  Portland will not continue to thrive if we accept doing business only\nwithin the confines of our city limits.  With the high tech economy of today\nand the reach of the internet, we must reach across borders.\n\n\"That's why I've led efforts to create business strategies --\nInternationalizing Greater Portland I & II -- which focused on air and trade\nconnections because our business partners are no longer just on the other\nside of town, or even the other side of the state.  We are competing in\nmarkets around the world, and with Delta's decision we are losing an\nimportant link to our partners and friends in Asia.  We also stand to lose\nconnections to major cities right here in the U.S.\n\n\"While I understand the economics of this decision -- the unexpected\ndownturn in the Asian economy, the continuing problems with the INS --  I\nhave learned something from our Asian partners over the years and that is\nthe importance of investing in relationships.\n\n\"Next week we will open the finest classical Chinese garden outside of\nChina.  Our goal is to create an atmosphere in Portland where people from\nother countries feel comfortable doing business with us because we honor\ntheir culture.\n\n\"This sets us back nearly 15 years -- 15 years of promoting Portland to\nAsian cities from Sapporo to Seoul.  My mission now is to work hard to\nensure it doesn't take us that long to recover.\n\n\"I will be working with our partners in the business community, the Port,\nour congressional delegation, and the Governor's office to look at\nalternative providers for Asian service. We may have opportunities because\nof the state of flux in the airlines industry.  I will also be asking for\nmore local support for our international efforts.  I have met with\nrepresentatives from other cities, and have been looking at the Seattle and\nAmsterdam models of promoting their cities internationally.\n\n\"Further, I will also be pushing Delta to re-examine its New York route.\nThis is the 12th largest flight out of PDX, carrying 200,000 people\nannually.  It's a route critical to our major retailers and financial\ninstitutions.\"",

  "text": "Ken/Joe,  As I was walking back to my office reflecting on our conversation, \nthere are three points that I mentioned but I think got lost in the \ndiscussion.\n\n1)  This needs to be a stock deal to avoid Indian tax (48%), poorly written \npreferential purchase language and gov't approval.  (Still requires RBI \napproval)  All of the numbers I have in the document assume a stock \ntransaction. \n\n2) RIL is very tax advantaged, currently and for the foreseeable future they \nwill be in an NOL position;  therefore, at the numbers we are discussing they \nshould see this as an unleveraged return opportunity of 16% (stock purchase \nfully taxed with no basis) to 27% (stock purchase shielded from taxes-- Btax \nscenario).   Again, the tax position makes RIL unique for this transaction \nand a very likely buyer at these numbers.  Few other parties will be as \npositioned to consider a stock transaction of a company with minimal Indian \nbasis, accept the operational conditions and be able to close as quickly.  \n\n 3) The idea of coupling the other India assets with the E&P is a good \nstrategy if your goal is to ultimately sale, but time is unimportant.   I've \ndone multi-asset deals before with a major and the bureaucracy rivals India.  \nThe due diligence on the multiple assets will eliminate any chance of closing \nthis year. In fact, I would be surprised if we could even get a PSA signed \nbefore year-end on a multi-asset deal, plus the gov't approvals become more \ncomplex.  \n\n If the goal is money in the door before 12/31/00,  I favor a buy/sell at \nKen's number.  If we go to October and don't get the documents in place we \nreally haven't lost anything because there is little likelihood of closing \nunder a traditional scenario even if we start today.   We will prepare our \ndataroom while the negotiations on the documents take place and be ready to \nbring in bidders by October. If we buy at these numbers I believe we can flip \nthe deal within 6-9 months if not sooner since we have operatorship, critical \nmass a major would covet, only one partner and Reliance is not a partner.  \n\nAlso,  If we elect to go to a traditional auction, I would strongly suggest \nwe keep the E&P separate from the other India assets, at least initially, to \nrun the auction with the best chance of getting a PSA signed before \nyear-end.   We can always combine them at a later date during negotiations \nonce we see how the process is going.  Too many pieces right out of the box \nwill be very cumbersome and time consuming.  If we have to combine them to \nget interest, we can do it as we see the need for an enhancement.\n \n\nMy final thought, if we do an outright sale to RIL ( not a pre-negotiated \nbuy/sell with stipulated closing dates,,, etc.) they will want to do a \ncertain amount of due diligence and rightfully so.   They would expect and \nprobably demand the same considerations as any other buyer including a \ndataroom visit to pick our brains one more time.  Again this becomes a time \nissue!!  Under the buy/sell scenario we have devised, there is no due \ndiligence period, the structure of the deal is stipulated and everything is \nhandled via representations and warranties in the pre-negotiated PSA.     \n\n\nLet me know how and when you wish to proceed.   I will pursue with complete \ndedication whichever option you select.\n\nThanks for the time to share my thoughts,\njeff",

  "text": "Dear Dean Walker -\n\nKen Lay asked me to respond to you re:  1). naming the new professorship the \nPinkney C. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship - this is fine.\n2)  He will be pleased to serve as the keynote speaker for the banquet on \nOctober 13.\n\nThanks.\n\nRosalee\n\n\n\n\n\"Walker, Bruce J.\" <Walker@missouri.edu> on 08/28/2000 04:17:56 PM\nTo: \"'kenneth.lay@enron.com'\" <kenneth.lay@enron.com>\ncc: \"'rosalee.fleming@enron.com'\" <rosalee.fleming@enron.com> \nSubject: P. Walker professorship and keynote request\n\n\nThanks so much for your most generous gift to complete the funding for the\nprofessorship honoring Pinkney Walker.  I'm delighted that you plan to\nattend the Davenport Society banquet on October 13.\n\nThe purpose of this e-mail, which Rosalee suggested as the most efficient\nway of reaching you, is two-fold:\n\n     1. To seek your endorsement of naming the new professorship the Pinkney\nC. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship.  Rather than designating the\nprofessorship for Business and Economics, for Business Theory, or for some\nother area, I'd like to use it to recognize and reward a faculty member in\nthe College of Business who is especially known for teaching effectiveness.\nBoth Bob Pugh and Ralph Clark endorse this approach; I have a call into\nHarold Hook to seek his input.\n\nA few points of elaboration:\n     * \"Distinguished\" is a standard adjective in the titles of such\npositions.\n     * We will use a committee of faculty and administrators within the\ncollege to select the recipient of the professorship, subject to my\napproval.\n     * And, I don't know if we will have the recipient selected by October\n13.\n\nThis name for the professorship (1) coincides with Pinkney's great strength,\n(2) allows me to avoid any \"turf battles\" (either within the college or with\nEconomics) and (3) underscores the great importance of teaching in the\ncollege.  Please let me know whether you are agreeable to this name.\n\n     2. To ask you to serve as the keynote speaker for the Davenport Society\nbanquet on October 13.  We would be honored if you would present a brief\ntalk (perhaps 10 minutes in length) related to some aspect of the future of\nbusiness.  Your doing so would certainly add luster to an always festive\nevent.  By way of brief background, Jack and Mary Bush, MU alumni who now\nlive in Dallas and are co-chairs of the Davenport Society this year, have\nchosen the future of business as the theme for the banquet and program.\nYour talk would come after dinner and could be preceded or followed\n(probably followed) by the announcement of the Pinkney Walker Professorship.\nI understand from Rosalee that you will be giving a talk in Austin the\nmorning of October 13; perhaps an abridged version of it would be suitable\nfor the Davenport Society banquet.  Of course, you have great latitude in\nchoosing the topic you would like to address.  Please let me know if you\nwill serve as the keynote speaker.\n\nIf you can give me quick responses to these 2 requests, we will complete the\nplans for the evening, which will include the annoucement of the Pinkney\nWalker Professorship and, I hope, a keynote address by you.  Naturally, if\nyou have questions, either you or Rosalee can call me.  My office # is\n573/882-6688, and my home # is 573/875-2972.\n\nLet me close by mentioning that there was some question as to whether or not\nPinkney would attend the banquet on October 13.  Apparently he had/has been\nexperiencing some health problems.  However, the latest I've heard is that\nhe intends to attend, due in large part to your commitment to be there.\nTime permitting, you might want to give him a quick call to tell him you'll\nsee him here in Columbia on October 13.  (By the way, if Pinkney and his\nwife arrive on October 12, I will invite them to attend an informal dinner I\nwill host that evening for members of the college's advisory board.  Of\ncourse, you are invited to attend the dinner on October 12 as well, but it's\nmy understanding that you will fly to Columbia on October 13.)\n\nKen, thanks very much.  I hope and trust that you had an ample dose of \"R&R\"\nduring your vacation.  I look forward to hearing from you.\n\n",

  "text": "Ken,  I thought it would be better if I typed my thoughts for you since my \nhand writing can be somewhat difficult to read. \n\nBefore you decide the methodology for moving our project beyond the D. Ambani \nphone call, I would like to share a few thoughts that I believe reduces the \nrisk of Enron being an E&P buyer.  I know the implications of making a large \nE&P purchase are far greater than just the cash requirement, but I believe \nwith the following changes to the plan presented yesterday and a little 3rd \nparty information, you may feel more comfortable making this decision.  Under \nthe buy/sell arrangement a small risk of buying will always be present, but I \nbelieve the risk reward ratio in this case has very strong merit.  My goals \nfor Enron are three fold; a) sale the assets, b) get cash in the door before \nyear-end, and c) get fair value for the assets given the current situation.  \nMy comments touch upon five topics:\n\n1)  Reverse the buy/sell process giving Enron the control vote\n2)  Pay the Penalty\n3) Contact someone at the Janus Fund to talk about Reliance's Financial \ncondition\n4) Thoughts on non-Reliance bidder's\n5) Information and the future process\n\nReverse the Buy/Sell Process:   The plan outlined yesterday using the \nbuy/sell scenario is the best scenario for achieving all of our goals.  The \nrisk for Enron which is most troubling is the possibility of being a buyer \nversus a desire to be a seller.  I firmly believe if we make one change to \nthe plan as described below, we can increase our probability of a successful \nsale to near 100%.  If we don't use a but/sell arrangement I am concerned \nthat we will not get fair value or cash in the door this year.   In fact, I \nsuspect we will elect not to sell because of contract or valuation problems, \nwhich in effect leave us with a stranded asset and a lot of employee \nproblems.   \n\nWhen you talk with Dhirubhai we can propose the buy/sell concept  with RIL \nmaking the first bid to purchase.  Enron then has the right to sell at that \nprice or increase the bid by 5% and RiL must sell.  Since we are now in the \ncontrol position the 10% tax logic we talked about yesterday no longer is \nvalid, so I would describe the 5% as a control premium.  The only reason we \nwant the buy option is in the event they offer a very low number.  I would \nsuspect them to bid in the $550 to $650 million range.  They just turned down \nmy offer to purchase their assets at $450mm and indicated we were \nsubstantially below their value when I tried to engage them in a dialogue.  \nThey know Enron paid $620 million just 12 months ago for the same position.  \nWe know they internally have reserves booked higher than ours and have a \nstrong desire to have a substantial upstream position that they can control.  \nIt is possible that RIL would bid less than $500 million but I put that \nprobability at less than one percent.  This reduces Enron's risk dramatically \nand increases our probability of getting all of our objectives met. We also \nget an added benefit, from pitching the deal with RIL as the first bidder,  \nbecause this will  strengthen the perception that we (Enron) want to be the \nbuyer, which is a key perception to have a fair auction with only one \nlegitimate buyer, Reliance.  \n\nIf we  pitch the deal as suggested above,  we need to recognise going in that \nthey probably want the control position as well.  I believe they would pay a \nvery large value for these assets due to their tax position and by bidding \nfirst they take great risk of leaving a lot of money on the table or not \ngetting the deal at all.   I would suspect that they will at a minimum \nsuggest we flip a coin to see who bids first.  Initially I would just say no, \nbut we may need to deal with this issue and probably should decide early on \nif it is a deal killer.  If we did flip a coin, we would wait until the \ndocuments were final and the escrow agreement was signed so there would be no \nbacking out without a penalty.  In this scenario it would actually help get a \nmore impartial document done quicker if neither party knew the bidding \nsequence until after the drafting was finalized.\n\nPay the Penalty: While it is not the way we want to do business, the worst \ncase scenario under the proposed escrow agreement is to forfeit  $25 million \nif we elected not to follow through in an Enron  buy scenario.   Considering \nthe upside to the buy/sell under either sequence (Enron first or RIL first) \nit may be worth the risk of losing the escrow under a black Friday scenario.  \nI want to think about this over the weekend, but while I was thinking this \nafternoon the risk reward seems to be very favorable.  \n\nContact someone at Janus Fund:  This was suggested yesterday and I would \nstrongly urge you to do this if you feel comfortable making the inquiry.  \nJanus bought approximately a  5% position in RIL about 1-2 months ago.  I \nthink you will get a very positive report on both the cash front and their \ndesire to make the upstream a key part of the company.\n\nThoughts on Non- Reliance Bidders:  I have spent a lot more time thinking \nabout this issue.   I can talk you through the reasons, but as long as \nReliance is involved and a western company can only purchase a 30% \nnon-operated working interest, we will have to take a huge discount to fair \nvalue.  I will be very surprised if we could get $450 million.  Again, going \nto the Shell's, BG's,,,etc  early on in the process,  I believe, is a huge \nmistake, both internally and externally.\n\nInformation Flow and Process:  Ken this is a very sensitive area but I feel \ncompelled to mention this to you.  I am concerned about too many people \nknowing our plan and strategy and possibly others wanting to branch out with \nthe intentions of helping, but actually causing problems.  This needs to be \nmanaged by one person, not three or four.  To meet all of our objectives this \nhas to be an orchestrated deal from a to z.  I think you know more about my \nbackground then most others in Enron.  I worked the E&P M&A business for 10 \nyears and did pretty well at it.  I know the oil business and I believe that \nis a key to getting a good deal done.  I know these assets and all of the \ncomplex issues surrounding the assets, our subsidiaries, tax issues and the \nbook considerations.  I'm the best person to get this deal done once you \ndecide the risk the company is willing to take.  I know the limits of my \nauthority and I will work within those bounds and keep the OOC completely and \ntotally informed so proper decisions can be made when necessary. \n\nKen, I promise you I will use others in the company where and when \nappropriate.  If I need help in India, I would not hesitate to ask Sanjay for \nsuch.  However, the last thing we can afford is excess discussion in India on \nthis deal.  If Dhirubhai agrees to the deal, we need to get a meeting set in \nEurope at a neutral site to start the process.  My main objective is to  have \na successful deal.  \n\nI have decided not to go to India so we can concentrate on moving this \nforward.  Also, I will need your guidance on the future of the E&P plans for \nEnron when we decide the direction we plan to take on Panna, Mukta and \nTapti.  I have looked at the key people necessary to make this happen and can \ntalk to you about that as well if you so desire.\n\nThanks\njeff",

  "text": "Yesterday, Ken Lay spoke with MidAmerican CEO David Sokol regarding the \nattached new legislative amendment to provide a limited PUHCA exemption for \ncompanies with a high level of financial stability as determined by \nindependent market analysts (i.e. \"A\" rating for Holding Companies or \ninvestment grade rating for utility companies).  This is not a permanent \nexemption as PUHCA would again apply should the company loose its high rating.\n\nMidAmerican's lobbyist reported this conversation to me along with Ken Lay's \nreported commitment that we would review it as soon as we could.  Reportedly, \nKen Lay was non-committal but not negatively disposed.\n\nThe utility strategy is to have Senator Bob Kerrey (D-NE) offer this as an \namendment to a \"must pass\" piece of legislation during the waning days of \nthis Congressional session.  This will be separate from the utilities' \nstrategy to enact Private Use legislation (H.R. 4971, S. 2967 which includes \ntax language to exclude water and sewage connection fees from gross income as \ncontributions to capital and language to increase the amount permitted to \npaid into nuclear decommissioning reserve funds primarily  for Commonwealth \nEdison) and to enact stand-alone Reliability legislation (S. 2071 and H.R. \n2944).\n\nSenator Kerrey has already spoken to Senator Gramm (R-TX) about this PUHCA \namendment and Gramm was reportedly  non-committal but not negatively disposed \nto the idea.  I will follow-up with Gramm's staff next week after they've \nreviewed it and convey their views to you.  According to MidAmerican,  the \nconcept to insure stockholder protection along with consumer protection was \nSenator Kerrey's idea.  \n\nIt is possible that Congressman Dingell (D-MI) and Congressman Markey (D-MA) \nwould still actively oppose this limited exemption, especially given the fact \nthat Congressman Dingell (who would Chair the Commerce Committee should the \nDemocrats regain control of the House) has recently said that whether or not \nhe is Commerce Committee Chairman next Congress, that comprehensive \nelectricity restructuring legislation including PUHCA repeal is \"at least \nthree years away from happening.\"\n\nSteve and Rick, can we get a temperature gauge next week as to our position \non this amendment?  As a reminder, Enron's position here-to-date has been to \noppose stand-alone PUHCA repeal as this is the one provision utilities like \nSouthern Company really want.  To date, this strategy has worked with the \nMidAmerican Utility Group willing to support our transmission open access \nprovisions in turn for our PUHCA exemption support. \n\n",

The economic and \nbusiness climate is positive and full of new opportunities as Mexico finally \ncompletes a long transition from one-party dominance to pluralist democracy, \nadding political maturity to a more competitive market economy.\n\nIn light of the above, the World Economic Forum will hold a Mexico Meeting \n2000 on 4-5 December in Mexico City.

We have already received \nconfirmation that President-elect Vicente Fox and Mexican Central Bank \nGovernor Guillermo Ortiz will participate. We are also expecting the presence \nof the future key cabinet members and state governors.\n\nAs usual, the World Economic Forum pulls together the right group of leaders \nto discuss issues, build a network of contacts and identify where future \nbusiness opportunities and risks lie. The Meeting will focus on four main \ntopics: the country's political and social agenda, Mexico's commercial \nrelationships with the rest of the world, the new economy and the key issues \nfor the country's main industries.\n\nPlease consult our website, http://www.weforum.org/mexico, where information \nwill be updated as soon as it becomes available.\n\nFor further information, please do not hesitate to contact Gisela Galicia at \n(41 22) 869 1450 or mailto:mexicomeeting@weforum.org\n(  ) Please send me more information on the conditions for participation.\n\n(  ) Please send information to:\n\n- Name:\n- Position:\n- Company:\n- Tel.:\n- Fax:\n- E-mail:\n\n( XX ) I am unable to participate in the Mexico Meeting 2000.\n\nPlease tick the appropriate response and return this form to Gisela Galicia \nby fax: (41 22) 786 2744 or via e-mail: mailto:mexicomeeting@weforum.org\nWe look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\n\n\n",

According to MidAmerican,  the \nconcept to insure stockholder protection along with consumer protection was \nSenator Kerrey's idea.  \n\nIt is possible that Congressman Dingell (D-MI) and Congressman Markey (D-MA) \nwould still actively oppose this limited exemption, especially given the fact \nthat Congressman Dingell (who would Chair the Commerce Committee should the \nDemocrats regain control of the House) has recently said that whether or not \nhe is Commerce Committee Chairman next Congress, that comprehensive \nelectricity restructuring legislation including PUHCA repeal is \"at least \nthree years away from happening.\"\n\nSteve and Rick, can we get a temperature gauge next week as to our position \non this amendment?  As a reminder, Enron's position here-to-date has been to \noppose stand-alone PUHCA repeal as this is the one provision utilities like \nSouthern Company really want.  To date, this strategy has worked with the \nMidAmerican Utility Group willing to support our transmission open access \nprovisions in turn for our PUHCA exemption support. \n\n\n\n\n",

  "text": "I wanted to provide you an update on where we stand related to several recent \ncontribution requests.\n\nTom Delay's Request -- We did fulfill the $10,000 request that came to us \nfrom Tom and Christine Delay for the Fort Bend Child Advocates.  In addition, \nwe've arranged with Heather for your family's foundation to match Enron's \ngift.  I spoke directly with Christine Delay several times and they are very \nappreciative of the gifts and our efforts to correct the initial oversight.\n\nYMCA --  I've had multiple conversations with Heather about a combined \nEnron/Lay Family contribution to the YMCA.  According to Heather, you and \nLinda have agreed to contribute $500,000 and ask that Enron match.  We are, \nof course, willing to do that.  I am scheduling a meeting with Bill Phillips \nof the YMCA to discuss the gift.  We will be talking to him about naming \nopportunities as well as the YMCA's consideration of extending services to \nEnron employees at the downtown YMCA, as well as outlying facilities.  (FYI:  \nThe downtown YMCA recently chose to cancel the agreement we'd had with them \nallowing Body Shop members to utilize the facility.)\n\nOther Capital Campaigns -- We are currently evaluating several other capital \ncontribution requests.  Each is outlined below.  We are proceeding in several \nways.  First, I am scheduling a meeting with Marty Sunde to discuss EES's \ninterest in pursuing energy service agreements with these not-for-profit \ninstitutions.  As you know, EES is focusing its current efforts on much \nlarger scale energy portfolios.  Secondly, I am working to evaluate these \nrequests based on the leveraging opportunities associated with each.  \nFinally, we want to be equitable in our giving to these local campaigns as \nwell as consistent in our giving philosophy.  We are working to balance these \nrequests relative to each other and to our goal to transfer dollars away from \nmulti-year gifts toward programs.\n\nTexas Heart Institute -- I had breakfast yesterday with Bob Devlin, Dr. \nDenton Cooley, Jack Doherty and Meredith Long.  They shared with me plans for \na new Texas Heart Institute building in the Medical Center.  (The building \nwill bear a striking resemblance to our buildings -- oval in shape and bluish \nglass.)  They are conducting a $75 million campaign -- $42 million to build \nand equip the building and $33 million to sustain programs in research and \neducation.  They are requesting $1 million from Enron and will allow us to \nspecify how the gift is spent.  American General and Shell Oil Foundation \nhave each contributed $1 million\n\nBaylor College of Medicine -- Amy Lee and I had lunch last week with several \nfolks from Baylor.  They are in the midst of a campaign to fund their many \nprograms in research and education.  We discussed opportunities to expand our \nexisting medical-based literacy program - Prescription for Reading.  They \nalso outlined for us numerous other sponsorship opportunities.  No specific \ndollar amount was requested.  While several pharmaceutical companies have \ncontributed in the $500,000 to $1 million range, most of our local peers are \nwithin the $100,000 to $500,000 range.\n\nUniversity of Houston - MD Anderson Library and the Honors College -- As you \nknow, the University is requesting $500,000 from Enron over 5 years to \nsupport renovation of the library.  Since our call with Harriet Latimer, I've \nconducted some research to determine what other local corporations are \ncontributing.  Currently, no companies have made a financial commitment.  In \nfact, only Compaq and Shell have committed at all with in-kind \ncontributions.  While I am confident that we will support this in some way, I \nam particularly interested in speaking with Steve Barth and Chet Gladchuck at \nthe University to determine if the library could be rolled into the energy \nservices agreement we are currently evaluating with the University's athletic \ndepartment.\n\nOn a separate note, you'd forwarded to me a request from the University to \nfund a publication \"The Future of International Education:  Directions & \nOpportunities.\"  Elyse Kalmans discussed this with her contacts at U of H.  \nThey indicated that this was not a high priority for them and would rather \nhave Enron commit its resources to other University endeavors, such as the \nlibrary.  We have chosen to decline this request.\n\nI apologize for the length of this memo.  However, I did want to keep you \nupdated on the status of these various requests.  I will present \nrecommendations to you on each of these pending requests in the coming \nweeks.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or comments, please \ncontact me. \n",

  "text": "I got Goldberg's comments this morning on the term sheet with the Rockets.\nthere are a number of technical comments which we will make.  There are\nabout four substantive comments that we are working on and will review with\nTracey Ellison.  Two of the comments relate to you.  Goldberg wants to limit\nseats to a maximum of 20 per Partner, not 300 total, because he said you\nsaid at the meeting that each Partner would have a maximum of 20 seats.  I\ndidn't recall that any such statement by you was meant to limit the 300\nseats but was merely an indication of about how many each Partner would\nhave.  Goldberg admitted the 300 seats was on the sheet handed out at the\nmeeting.  I can't believe Goldberg is continuing to haggle on this issue.  I\nthink we should say that the maximum of 300 seats is what the Partners\napproved and be done with it.\n\nThe other issue is the amount of the referendum funding.  Goldberg said he\nunderstood that the Rockets would match what the \"Partners\" would put up.\nAlternatively he wants the right for the Rockets to raise part of their $1.5\nmillion from others and get credit for it.  I'm not sure whether the Rockets\nwould interfere with you raising your balance of the $1.5 million.  In any\ncase I need your input on this issue both for the Rockets term sheet and\ndetermining how much we need to get advanced on the loan from the Sports\nAuthority.\n\nJohn S.

This is not a permanent \nexemption as PUHCA would again apply should the company loose its high rating.\n\nMidAmerican's lobbyist reported this conversation to me along with Ken Lay's \nreported commitment that we would review it as soon as we could.  Reportedly, \nKen Lay was non-committal but not negatively disposed.\n\nThe utility strategy is to have Senator Bob Kerrey (D-NE) offer this as an \namendment to a \"must pass\" piece of legislation during the waning days of \nthis Congressional session.  This will be separate from the utilities' \nstrategy to enact Private Use legislation (H.R. 4971, S. 2967 which includes \ntax language to exclude water and sewage connection fees from gross income as \ncontributions to capital and language to increase the amount permitted to \npaid into nuclear decommissioning reserve funds primarily  for Commonwealth \nEdison) and to enact stand-alone Reliability legislation (S. 2071 and H.R. \n2944).\n\nSenator Kerrey has already spoken to Senator Gramm (R-TX) about this PUHCA \namendment and Gramm was reportedly  non-committal but not negatively disposed \nto the idea.  I will follow-up with Gramm's staff next week after they've \nreviewed it and convey their views to you.

  "text": "This message contains the latest issue of the CSIS Watch, focusing on U.S. \ninvolvement in Colombia and U.S.-South African relations.\n\nFor further information, contact the CSIS Director of Studies Office at \n202-887-0200, or reply to this e-mail.\n\n*************************\nU.S. Involvement in Colombia.\n\nEdward Luttwak, CSIS senior fellow, says that the Colombian guerrilla groups, \nthe FARC and ELN, aren't trained, aren't disciplined, and don't know how to \nshoot. How then do they control vast amounts of territory in southern \nColombia? Because the Colombian army was never properly trained, asserts \nLuttwak. And the U.S. military is now teaching the Colombian army tactics \nthat aren't appropriate for a jungle environment. Luttwak believes that the \n$1.3 billion aid package signed by Clinton to help the Colombian army is a \nmistake. Plus, whatever the United States does this year in terms of aid, it \nwill have to do again next year.\n\nWhy is the United States getting involved?  The popular reason repeated on \nthe Hill is to destroy the Colombian narcotics trade. Colombia contains most \nof the narcotics activity now, but that can easily move to a different \ncountry. The worst thing the United States could do, says Luttwak, would be \nto push the bulk of the coca production to a different Andean country in the \n\"arc of fragility.\" U.S. involvement also helps to mitigate the chances of \nthe guerrillas overthrowing the civilian government, says Luttwak, noting \nthat President Andres Pastrana's popularity is extremely low.\n\nWhat then should the United States do? Luttwak's answer is to organize mobile \ntraining teams of people (as the United States did in El Salvador) to go into \nvillages to create home guards, which would use weapons of a different \ncaliber than the army. Luttwak asserts that this would work because people \naren't divided politically at the village level. Such a solution, however, \nwill not diminish narcotics trafficking.\n\n\nThe United States and South Africa: Drifting Apart?\nThe U.S.-South African relationship has undergone a significant shift, \nasserts Stephen Morrison, director of the CSIS Africa Program. The result of \nthis shift is that the United States now feels that it needs South Africa \nmuch less than it did six years ago, while South Africa has come to value its \nrelations with the United States much more than ever before.\n\nFor both countries, however, there has been a ratcheting down of \nexpectations.  South African president Thabo Mbeki's May visit to Washington \nwas marked by an anxiety that the next administration may reduce its contact \nwith Africa. Thus, Mbeki attempted to reach out to a number of audiences-both \nthe Bush and Gore camps as well as the U.S. Congress, corporate sector, and \nmedia. The response of the latter three was rather muted.\n\nWhile the Gore-Mbeki Binational Commission proved that high-level \nintervention is essential to move forward on key issues, lacking was serious \ncooperation at the diplomatic level to respond to crises such as those in \nCongo, Angola, Zimbabwe, Sudan, Nigeria, or Sierra Leone. Plus, South Africa, \nfueled by protectionist interests, was largely ambivalent to the Africa \nGrowth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). It remains to be seen if the South African \nprivate sector will seize this opportunity.\n\nMorrison says that in the future, the relationship will be evaluated \naccording to the level of development of joint diplomatic initiatives in \nZimbabwe and Congo, collaboration on the AIDS epidemic, security enhancement, \ntrade and investment, and debt relief. Some form of the binational commission \nshould remain in place for the next administration, warns Morrison, because \notherwise there will be contentious wrangling over issues of trade and \ninvestment, international property rights, AIDS policy, and security.\n\n\n - Watch 233.doc",

This is a very delicate situation in that WWF will use whatever \nyou say, even the hint of the slightest committement, against Enron in the \nfuture. As you know, I have found this group the most dishonest, back \ndealing  NGO I have ever dealt with.When Shell has these meetings, they have \nmy counterpart meet ahead of time with the the WWF top staff person and work \nout an agenda. For example, you will have to be throughly briefed on the \nBolivian situation before we go in.  I also would find it counter productive \nto include any of the low level WWF staff that went to this meeting when \nShell held it last.   Remember, this is the group that publicly announced \nthat Enron has gotten away with murder for years and we are going to get \nthem.  They also have te goal of wanting to lock us up in a world wide \npartnership. This is the last groupo I would do this with.\n\nI guess this is a long way of saying that we need to go in their well \nprepared with our eyes wide open. Did you commit to any agenda when you set \nup the meeting? I will contact their staff and see what they want to discuss \nand when I get back to the states, I start pulling materials together.",

On a Cox\n> Television segment broadcast across the nation Fleenor argued that these\n> taxes discourage entrepreneurism and make it difficult for taxpayers to\n> pass small businesses or family farms from one generation to the next.  In\n> addition, he argued that they added significant complexity to the tax\n> code.\n> * Later, on WJR radio in Detroit, Fleenor filled in for House Majority\n> Leader Dick Armey, who was called away for a vote, and took calls from\n> listeners about the effects of the tax.  Here Fleenor reiterated his\n> earlier remarks and argued that the adverse effects of the tax were\n> particularly hard to justify in light of the fact that these taxes only\n> accounted for about 1 percent of federal revenues.\n>\n> While spending a lot of time explaining the taxes that are levied after\n> death, the staff was also researching the hidden taxes that the living pay\n> every day, often without realizing it. Communications director Bill Ahern\n> and economist Scott Moody helped ABC News Correspondent John Stossel\n> prepare a story on all the taxes that a typical small business owner in\n> Missouri faces throughout his workday. If the story is completed as\n> scheduled, you can look for the upcoming segment on ABC's 20/20.\n>\n> If you have any questions or need additional information please contact me\n> by phone at 202/661-4226, by e-mail at jrogers@taxfoundation.org or go to\n> the Tax Foundation's web site at www.taxfoundation.org.\n>\n> ",

I have asked Gil to send you his presentation as well for the \nmeeting.\n\nBack to your presentation (the draft slides of which I am delivering to you \ntoday), Dan Yergin thought it would be appropriate for you to give an \noverview of the situation as the \"teacher\" or \"professor.\"  Some questions \nthat you could address would include:\n\nWhere has the industry come from, and what lessons have we learned?\n\nHow is the business different today?\n\nWhat public policy conclusions are implicit in this history?\n\nI think our comparative advantage over the specialists who will be presenting \nbefore and after your keynote is that you have \"been there\" in the evolution \nof the natural gas market, and Enron is at the forefront of helping customers \ndeal with price and supply uncertainty.  There is also a good opportunity to \nstress the need for new industry \"best practices\" (more hedging) and the \nright public policies to deal with this issue (from \"do no harm\" to expanding \nincentives in the market).\n\n- Rob\n\n",

The OPIC \nauthorization bill was passed by a big margin, the Defense Appropriation bill \ngiving the President authority to extend the exemptions on India sanctions, \nsuccess with the Trade Adjustment Act language important to a problem raised \n\"recently\" by PGE, good news on Cong. Barton's willingness to consider some \npositive language in the electricity restructuring bill, etc. Yesterday, \nSudaker Rao called me from the Indian Embassy to read me a letter Ambassador \nChandra wrote to Dean O'Hair , chair of the US-India Business Council \nthanking them and Enron by name for the success on the sanctions effort. Our \nUS WTO Energy Services Coalition grew to 40 members and next week we lead the \nUS-Bolivia Business Partnership on its trip to Bolivia to meet with President \nBanzer and others in the Bolivian political and business leadership. \n\nAt Enron, Ken frequently cites the Enron people who involve themselves in \nmaking things happen. I think the items cited above are examples of what Ken \nsays to all of us. Ken and Rosalee are always ready to get involved as they \ndid in moving the position letter signed by Ken in the OPIC issue. My group \ndid the preparation of the letter and moved it to the Hill in a timely \nfashion. John Hardy working from material prepared by Kelly Kimberly on the \nCuiba update (the House International Relations Committee senior staff was \nworried that it could be used to support some adverse amendment) preped the \nstaff and drafted a one-pager answer sheet. This over-all effort on the OPIC \nissue was repeated on all of the other matters assigned.\n\nIt is very rewarding to be part of an organization that constantly works to \nwin. Ken's right; people do make the difference at Enron. Thanks to all.\n\nJoe\n\n\nLora Sullivan\n10/13/99 06:27 PM\n\n\nTo: Joe Allen/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Rob Bradley/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Andrew S \nFastow/HOU/ECT@ECT, Bill Gathmann/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, John \nHardy/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES, Brian \nRedmond/HOU/ECT@ECT, Chris Long/Corp/Enron@Enron, Joseph W \nSutton/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Terence H \nThorn/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Dennis Ulak/EOG/Enron@Enron, Joe \nHillings/Corp/Enron@Enron, Cynthia Sandherr/Corp/Enron@Enron, Jeffrey \nKeeler/Corp/Enron@Enron, Scott Reblitz/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, \nMarc Eichmann/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Jay \nSparling/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Carolyn \nCooney/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Lora Sullivan/Corp/Enron@Enron\ncc:  \nSubject: OPIC Reauthorization -- Passed in House 10/13/99\n\nThe House just passed a four-year reauthorization of OPIC.

The Web site provides patients\n\ninformation about diabetes and gives them tools to help manage their\n\ndisease.\n\n\n\n\"Diabetes is a progressive, potentially debilitating disease that requires\n\nregular monitoring of blood sugar, blood pressure and weight, among other\n\nthings,\" said Doug Rude, e-commerce team leader, Eli Lilly and Company.\n\n\"Lillydiabetes.com can help empower patients and their families with the\n\ninformation and tools necessary to manage their disease and live healthier\n\nlives.\"\n\n\n\nLillydiabetes.com has a number of features and tools to encourage\n\naggressive management of diabetes.  Because diabetes is a chronic,\n\nprogressive disease, it is important that patients closely track their\n\nprogress toward better blood-sugar control, as well as the development of\n\ndiabetes-related complications. Those who register with the site have\n\naccess\n\nto customizable \"Measures of Control\" tools designed to help patients\n\nmonitor their diabetes and the complications that can arise.  The Measures\n\nof Control tools include:\n\n\n\n?    HbA1c Chart (blood-sugar control) ? Hemoglobin A1c test measures\naverage blood-sugar levels over a two to three-month period.  Each time an\nHbA1c test is done, patients can enter the value and save it as a color\ngraph, which then can be used to track the patient's progress toward better\nblood-sugar control.\n?    Height and Weight Index ? Excess body fat can lead to insulin\nresistance, a major factor in the development of type 2 diabetes.  This\ntool helps patients calculate their body mass index, which is a measure of\nbody weight relative to height.  The Web site then provides a place to save\nthat information and chart progress toward desired weight.\n\n\n?    Blood Pressure Chart ? A common complication of diabetes is high blood\npressure, which can lead to heart disease as well as signal other\npotentially serious problems, such as diabetic kidney disease.  This tool\nallows patients to enter their blood pressure levels, save them and chart\ntheir progress.\n\n\nOther resources found on lillydiabetes.com include:\n\n\n\nProduct Information ? With more than 75 years of innovation in diabetes\n\ncare, Eli Lilly and Company has developed many products for the treatment\n\nof diabetes.  This section informs users about treatment options and the\n\nlatest breakthroughs.\n\n\n\nLilly Diabetes Today?  Newsletter ? Users can request to receive by e-mail\n\nthis newsletter, which provides information about the latest diabetes\n\ndevelopments and research, as well as recipe ideas and inspiring articles.\n\n\n\nPatient Check List ? This section provides patients and family members with\n\na list of issues that should be addressed by their doctor, enabling them to\n\nwork with their physician to aggressively manage their disease.\n\n\n\nEducational Resources ? Lillydiabetes.com provides information on an array\n\nof diabetes-related topics.  Subject headings include:  About Diabetes,\n\nDiabetes Management, Planning Meals, Diabetes Resources, and Diabetes\n\nProducts.\n\n\n\nLilly plans to add new tools and features to the site every 90 days.  The\n\nnew features will help equip patients, physicians and other health care\n\nprofessionals with online tools that improve understanding of the disease\n\nand delivery of care to patients.\n\n\n\n\n\nEli Lilly and Company\n\nLilly, a leading innovation-driven corporation, is developing a growing\n\nportfolio of best-in-class pharmaceutical products by applying the latest\n\nresearch from its own worldwide laboratories and from collaborations with\n\neminent scientific organizations.

The study's primary efficacy measure was the Young-Mania\n\nRating Scale (Y-MRS), an 11-item scale used to assess the severity of a\n\npatient's mania. Key study endpoint findings included:\n\n\n\n?    The Zyprexa group experienced a significantly greater improvement on\nthe Y-MRS total score than did patients treated with valproate (49% vs.\n38%).\n?    A greater proportion of Zyprexa patients achieved remission from manic\nsymptoms (defined as Y-MRS Total Score < 12) compared with valproate\npatients (47% vs. 34%).\n?    54% of patients on Zyprexa experienced a 50% or more improvement in\nY?MRS scores compared with 42% of the valproate patients.\n?    Zyprexa patients demonstrated a statistically significant improvement\nin certain Y-MRS Individual Item Scores compared with valproate patients:\nactivity/energy (53% vs. 41%), sleep (69% vs. 45%) and language-thought\ndisorder (49% vs. 35%).  Changes in other core symptoms of mania as defined\nby the Y-MRS Individual Item Scores were similar for the two treatment\ngroups.\n\n\n\n\nStudy Design\n\nThe three-week, randomized, parallel, double-blind, acute-phase study\n\nexamined 251 hospitalized patients at 44 sites who met the DSM-IV criteria\n\nfor a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder and were experiencing acute manic or\n\nmixed episodes. Subjects received olanzapine in a flexible dose range of 5\n\nto 20 mg/day (once daily) or valproate in a flexible does range of 500 to\n\n2,500  mg/day (multiple doses per day). The mean ending dose for Zyprexa\n\nwas 17 mg/day and the mean ending dose for valproate was 1500 mg/day. In\n\naddition, plasma levels were monitored to ensure valproate trough levels\n\nwere maintained within the targeted therapeutic range of 50-125 ?g/mL; the\n\nmean value of all levels obtained was 79.4 ?g/mL. Clinicians determined\n\ndosing based on each patient's clinical response as well as the blood\n\nlevels in patients taking valproate. Lorazepam use was restricted to a\n\nmaximum dose of 2 mg/day, and administration was prohibited within eight\n\nhours of a psychiatric exam.\n\n\n\nAdditional Study Results\n\nNeither Zyprexa nor valproate induced depressive symptoms in bipolar manic\n\nor mixed patients.  In fact, both Zyprexa and valproate patients showed an\n\nimprovement in depressive symptoms as measured by the Hamilton Depression\n\nRating Scale (HAMD-21).  However, Zyprexa patients showed greater\n\nimprovement at the study endpoint in HAMD-21 scores (35% vs. 24%).  The\n\neffects of Zyprexa have not yet been studied in bipolar depression.\n\n\n\nZyprexa was generally well tolerated. The most common and significantly\n\ndifferent adverse events for Zyprexa were somnolence (39.2% vs. 20.6% for\n\nvalproate), dry mouth (33.6% vs. 6.3%), and increased appetite (12.0% vs.\n\n2.4%).  The most common adverse event for valproate was nausea (28.6% vs.\n\n10.4% for Zyprexa). Additional safety information for Zyprexa and valproate\n\ncan be obtained from their package inserts.\n\n\n\n\"These data support the value of Zyprexa as a much needed treatment\n\noption,\" said Mauricio Tohen, M.D., Dr. P.H., medical adviser, Lilly\n\nResearch Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, and lead investigator for the\n\nstudy.  \"The findings provide further evidence that Zyprexa effectively\n\nstabilizes mood in patients with bipolar disorder.\"\n\n\n\nManic symptoms occur during the manic phase of bipolar disorder, a lifelong\n\nillness characterized by disruptive swings in mood.  Symptoms include\n\nabnormal elation and/or irritability, often accompanied by an unrealistic\n\nbelief in one's own abilities, increased sex drive, delusions and alcohol\n\nor drug abuse.  People with bipolar disorder also may experience mixed\n\nepisodes, marked by symptoms of mania and clinical depression occurring\n\nsimultaneously. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,\n\nFourth Edition (DSM-IV).  American Psychiatric Association, 1994.\n\n\nZyprexa (olanzapine, Lilly)\nvalproate (Depakote, Abbott)\n\n\nThe study findings are particularly pertinent in light of valproate's\n\nrecent revised black box warning from the Food and Drug Administration\n\nfollowing reports of life-threatening pancreatitis in both children and\n\nadults.\n\n\n\n\"Physicians have good reason to take these new data into account,\" said\n\nCarlos A. Zarate, M.D., associate professor of psychiatry and director,\n\nbipolar and psychotic disorders program, University of Massachusetts\n\nMedical Center.  \"The efficacy of Zyprexa coupled with its favorable safety\n\nprofile suggest that it may provide a timely treatment alternative for\n\npatients with bipolar disorder.\"\n\n\n\nZyprexa is indicated in the United States for the management of the\n\nmanifestations of psychotic disorders as demonstrated in short-term\n\nclinical trials with schizophrenia patients.  It is also approved for the\n\nshort-term treatment of acute manic episodes associated with bipolar\n\ndisorder.\n\n\n\nIn the original schizophrenia registration trials, olanzapine was generally\n\nwell tolerated.  However, as with all medications, olanzapine was\n\nassociated with some side effects.  In the original six-week, acute-phase\n\nschizophrenia trials, the most common treatment-emergent adverse event\n\nassociated with olanzapine was somnolence.  Other common events were\n\ndizziness, weight gain, constipation, akathisia (restlessness), and\n\npostural hypotension.  Modest elevations of prolactin were also seen,\n\nalthough mean changes from baseline to endpoint were not statistically\n\nsignificantly different between olanzapine and placebo.  A small number of\n\npatients experienced asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminase; none\n\nof these patients developed jaundice or drug-induced hepatitis.\n\n\n\nIn short-term (three- and four-week) acute bipolar mania trials, the most\n\ncommon treatment-emergent adverse event associated with olanzapine was\n\nsomnolence.  Other common events were dry mouth, dizziness, asthenia,\n\nconstipation, dyspepsia, increased appetite, and tremor.\n\n\n\nLilly, a leading innovation-driven corporation, is developing a growing\n\nportfolio of best-in-class pharmaceutical products by applying the latest\n\nresearch from its own worldwide laboratories and from collaborations with\n\neminent scientific organizations.

In short, his speech was great!\n\nI don't know if/where this sort of speaker would be helpful to Enron, but I \nwanted you to know about him.  Volunteer Houston brought him to town, so I'm \nsure they know how to get a hold of him.  I realize he is not a corporate \norganization expert, but he's one heck of a motivational speaker.

If you agree and time permits, they also would like to \nbriefly film you in your office and in a meeting setting, which we could \nstage in the board room.  \n\nIn the interview, the reporters will want you to explain how Enron has \nsuccessfully changed from an old economy to a new economy company.  They will \nbe interested to know what enabled such dramatic change and how Enron has \nachieved such success in B2B, broadband, energy services and merchant \nactivities.  They also would appreciate your thoughts on how these models may \napply in Japan, as well as your evaluation of the Japanese market and our \ngeneral business strategy for the market.\n\nBy tomorrow, we will forward a tentative list of questions from the NHK \nreporters.  In addition, Joe Hirl and his group are preparing briefing \nmaterials on the Japanese market and Enron Japan, which will be faxed to you \nover the weekend. ",

In this\nlight, I read the recent article in the Wall Street Journal suggesting that\nthe Kuht-TV spectrum allotment includes substantial unused bandwidth which\nwe are legally permitted to lease to the private sector.  The Journal, based\non the recent UK auction, extrapolated the overall worth of the bandwidth at\n$160 billion.  Needless to say, if we could realize a small fraction of\nthat, for something from which we currently derive nothing, it could be a\nhuge boost to our efforts to obtain the additional funding we need as we\nmove to Tier One status.\n\nSince Enron is the leader in the market for bandwidth, I was hoping you or\nsomeone at Enron could give us some advice on what we own, its value, if\nany, and how we might think about realizing on any such value.  From Enron's\nperspective, perhaps there is a niche market for Enron to make by helping\norganize educational institutions that own such bandwidth to exploit the\nvalue of that asset.\n\nAny thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\nBest regards.\n\nGary\n",

When \nmy previous firm closed  it's Houston offices at the end of last December, \nall mail was collected and  forwarded to New York for sorting and \nredistribution. The mail from January that  should have been sent to me was \napparently sitting in a corner all these months  in the New York mail room of \nCurtis, Mallet (my previous firm), and was  delivered to me yesterday, \nincluding your letter. You can imagine what my  reaction was to my previous \nfirm's management concerning this nine month delay.  I am most distressed, \nhowever, to have missed the opportunity to participate in  the Center for \nHouston's Future's endeavors, which I most certainly would have,  and am \nsomewhat surprised that my failure to respond to such an important effort  \nnever came up in conversation among us?--- we've been around each other  \ninnumerable times since the letter was sent. My apologies to the both of you \nand  to the Board of Directors of the Center. I care deeply about this city \nand  region, and would have felt privileged to have participated.

It appears that at least for us, there is no pot\nof gold at the end of the bandwidth rainbow.  One wonders about the decision\nthat was apparently make in the early 1990s to decline this opportunity.\nHowever, we will continue to look into the matter.\n\nArt\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Buchanan, Averill E On Behalf Of Hugetz, Edward T\nSent: Friday, September 15, 2000 2:01 PM\nTo: Smith, Arthur K\nCc: Harris, Randy J; Duffy, Dennis\nSubject: RE: UH bandwidth\n\n\n\nArt -\n\nThis afternoon I spoke to Jeff Clarke about Gary Rosenthal's emails\nregarding bandwidth.  Jeff has been in Washington this week and he had the\nopportunity to talk to Todd Gray, who is our telecommunications lawyer at\nDow Lohnes.  Todd is very familiar with the Wall Street Journal article -\nthe writers interviewed him extensively.  He told Jeff that what was not\nmade clear in the article was that the class of spectrum that they were\nreferring to was the ITFS spectrum.  The UH System does not own any\nbandwidth in this spectrum.  The broadcast spectrum that KUHT uses is in a\ndifferent class.  In the early 90's the System had the opportunity to\nacquire a license for ITFS spectrum and declined.\n\nThe ITFS spectrum is a closed circuit system that covers a relatively small\nradius of 10-20 miles.  It is bandwidth that is very attractive to wireless\ncompanies, however, Todd does not think there is nearly the \"gold mine\" for\nuniversities that own the spectrum as indicated in the article.\n\nWhen Dennis Duffy returns on Monday, he and I will call Todd Gray to get\nfurther details.\n\nEd\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Smith, Arthur K\nSent: Friday, September 15, 2000 10:49 AM\nTo: Harris, Randy J; Duffy, Dennis; Hugetz, Edward T\nSubject: FW: UH bandwidth\n\n\nRandy, Dennis, and Ed:\n\n FYI.\n\nArt\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Gary Rosenthal [mailto:rosenthal@heaneyrosenthal.com]\nSent: Friday, September 15, 2000 8:53 AM\nTo: Ken Lay\nCc: Arthur K. Smith\nSubject: UH bandwidth\n\n\nKen,\n\nI hope things are well with you.\n\nI've taken on in the last year of my 6 year term the regents' chairmanship\nand so I am busy working on how to help further accelerate the good things\nthat have occurred since we brought Art and his team to Houston.  In this\nlight, I read the recent article in the Wall Street Journal suggesting that\nthe Kuht-TV spectrum allotment includes substantial unused bandwidth which\nwe are legally permitted to lease to the private sector.  The Journal, based\non the recent UK auction, extrapolated the overall worth of the bandwidth at\n$160 billion.  Needless to say, if we could realize a small fraction of\nthat, for something from which we currently derive nothing, it could be a\nhuge boost to our efforts to obtain the additional funding we need as we\nmove to Tier One status.\n\nSince Enron is the leader in the market for bandwidth, I was hoping you or\nsomeone at Enron could give us some advice on what we own, its value, if\nany, and how we might think about realizing on any such value.  From Enron's\nperspective, perhaps there is a niche market for Enron to make by helping\norganize educational institutions that own such bandwidth to exploit the\nvalue of that asset.\n\nAny thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\nBest regards.\n\nGary\n",

His press secretary announced that other vetoes were possible \nuntil the President and Congress reached agreement on the budget impasse. The \nDefense Appropriation conference report which contains authority to \npermanently extend the exemption relating to OPIC and ExIm financing for \nprojects in India is in the cue and could be affected by this action. \n\nCongressional authority for government operations expires this week as does \nthe one-year exemption. Congress must act by Thursday to extend both items. \nCongress is expected to adopt a \"continuing resolution\" through October 29 \nwhile the two branches of government work out their differences.\n\nThe President and Congressional leaders are to meet today to discuss and \npossibly establish a procedure for negotating the disagreement.\n\n",

  "text": "Dear Ken,\n\nI spoke to Bonnie today regarding the letter I sent you on September\n12th.  Bonnie suggested I follow-up that letter with this email.\n\nWith only 49 days to the election, we expect to see the oppositions'\nadvertisements on television and radio and in the mail in the next two\nweeks.  It's crucial to our ability to be competitive that we complete\nour media buys and print our next two direct mail pieces by October\n1st.  If we do, we know that we can win.\n\nYour initial contribution of $100,000 allowed us to do the first direct\nmail piece to 250,000 households (a sample was included with the letter\nI sent to you on the 12th).  We need to do at least two more of these\nmailings for our direct mail effort to be truly effective at a total\ncost of $190,000 for both (including postage).\n\nTo date, the combined total of contributions to the political campaign\nand the public education campaign is just over $1,040,000.  We expect an\nadditional $150,000 in pledges and new contributions in the next two to\nthree weeks.  While we are actively soliciting others for help, we are\ncurrently left with a shortfall of $310,000 to meet our minimum budget\nof $1.5 million.  (This budget would include the production and mailing\nof the three mail pieces described above)\n\nKen, the campaign is at a crossroads.  I cannot underscore enough how\nimportant your additional financial help is at this time.  And, I cannot\nunderscore enough how important one last significant contribution from\nyou would be to our success on November 7th.\n\nIf you have any questions, or need additional information, please do not\nhesitate to call me at (573) 446-3129 or reply to this email message.\n\nThank you for your past support and, hopefully, your additional\nsupport.  Passing Proposition A is a once in a generation opportunity.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKarl",

  "text": "To: Ken Lay, Jeffrey Skilling and the Enron Advisory Council\nFrom : Gavyn Davies, Goldman Sachs\n\nRe - The Global Oil Price Shock\n\n\nSince our meeting in Houston, the spike in world oil prices has gripped the\nattention of financial markets. I attach a paper which analyses the genesis\nof the present oil price increase, the likelihood of it proving permanent,\nand the probable impact on the world economy.\n\nThe bottom line is the following:\n\n1. The recent increase in the oil price has been due fundamentally to\nan increase in global demand, and not to the activities of OPEC, operating\nas an oil cartel. In fact, OPEC does not seem to have enough immediate\nsupply headroom to make much difference to the situation for many months.\nThe danger of shortages will therefore be very acute this winter, even with\nnormal weather conditions. This could lead to temporary spikes in the price\nto well over $40/barrel. We see a similar situation, or worse, developing in\nnatural gas.\n\n2. However, we do not see this situation as permanent. In terms of deep\nfundamentals, the equilibrium price for oil in the long term is still only\nabout $18/barrel. Within about 12 months, a large increase in the supply of\noil should push prices back down again, possibly quite sharply. Our present\nforecast for the average oil price in 2001 is $27/barrel, somewhat below\ntoday's spot price levels. But we do not expect to see this oil price\ndownturn before next summer.\n\n3. If oil prices do indeed average $27/bl in 2001, this will prove to\nbe an oil shock for the developed economies which is the same in magnitude\nas the Gulf War shock a decade ago. It will reduce net disposable income for\nthe OECD economies by about 0.7%, and add about 0.9% to headline inflation\nnumbers. All of these effects will already be in the data by about 2000 Q4,\nso on our main forecast there should be little or no further adverse effects\nthrough 2001.\n\n4. On this oil price scenario, GDP growth in the developed economies\nwill slow from about 3.9% in 2000 to about 3.4% in 2001 - not a bad\nout-turn.\n\n5. What if the oil price sustains $40/bl next year? This would give us\nanother round of effects about the same as those mentioned in para (3)\nabove. Even then, however, these effects should not be enough to push the\nworld into recession. Growth should still be adequate at about 2.5-3.0%.\n\n6. The main risks to this conclusion are that a spike in oil prices,\nand possible oil shortages, this winter cause a drop in equity prices, and a\nlarge dip in business and consumer confidence. This could then lead to a\nmore pronounced downturn in GDP next year, especially if it triggers the\nkind of correction in the US that Larry and I have been worrying about for a\nlong time. But this should prove just about avoidable, assuming sensible\npolicy responses..\n\n7. This may therefore all work out a bit like the winter of 1998/99.\nGoing into the winter, events occur which make people worry about recession.\nBusiness and consumer confidence, and equity markets, take a dip. But then\nthings improve, and it all turns out to be a buying opportunity.\n\n8. I hope so, anyway!\n\n\nBest wishes,\n\nGavyn\n\n ,2000 Goldman, Sachs & Co.

That is, this is the second contribution of that \namount and the maximum PAC contribution allowed. Ken has made a personal \ncontribution and I have each for $2,000 which is the max. Ken also hosted an \nevent for Bill in Houston early in the campaign. I attended an event for Bill \nlast night in Washington and he asked that I convey his appreciation for \nKen's support. I hope this is helpful information. ",

  "text": "Jeff, I understand at last week's PRC you asked Dick what the difference was \nbetween EECC, and, say, Brown and Root.  Let me try and answer that and at \nthe same time provide my recommendations on how EECC should evolve inside the \nnew Enron.\n\na. Enron does not \"need\" EECC; however, Enron has realized extra value from \nthe EECC model since 1990.\n\nb. EECC has taken an Enron liability (construction risk) and turned it into \nan asset (net income).  The risk was incurred by Enron's decision to build \nassets around the world.\n\nc. Enron could have out-sourced most or all of its engineering and \nconstruction management since 1990; but for about the same market price and \ncontract value, EECC has performed this work and accumulated over $250MM of \nnet income for Enron.\n\nd. In addition, EECC has performed the work generally in a manner superior to \nthe rest of the industry.  We have avoided disasters experienced by Brown and \nRoot, Black and Veatch, Snamprogetti, Raytheon, and Stone and Webster, which \npresumably could have occurred while performing Enron's work.  We've out \nperformed them because we had better risk management skills.  \n\ne. Cost avoidance:  In addition to performing this work at market price and \nat the same time making $250MM net income, as Jack Urquhart pointed out at \nthe last Board meeting, we have avoided tens and tens of millions of dollars \nof extra cost during execution.  The Enron portfolio of construction risks \naverages in billions of dollars, so even 1 or 2 percent in nuisance-type \nchange orders from outside contractors would have added up to substantial \nextra costs. \n\nf. ROIC:  as we recognized the Enron deal flow was decreasing, we were asked \nin the last two to three budget cycles to maintain or grow our net income.  \nTherefore, we embarked on non-Enron third-party construction business.  This \nmarginal income has increased our use of working capital.  Still, this year's \nreturn on all our working capital will be about $22%, down from 29% last \nyear, but still a 25% average over two years which is not unreasonable.  You \nasked about the details of our working capital; I'm scheduled to brief you on \n2 Oct.\n \ng. Internal flexibility:  there have been many instances over the years where \nhaving an internal contractor has enhanced the ability of an Enron developer \nto close the deal.  For example, on the 1999 Peakers, although other \ncompanies have out-sourced the same type of work, I assure you that because \nof the late start getting going by the Enron developers, having to out-source \nwould of easily cost us four to six weeks of summer revenues on the \nschedule.  On our current Dabhol LNG project, an outside turnkey contractor \nwould never be motivated to try and maintain the current schedule, given the \nweaknesses in the Owners' contractual positions, including quarry suitability \nand subsea surface rock surprises, etc.  Many other examples abound.\n\nh. Downsizing risks:  I think the risk to Enron of what happens to a large \nEECC in the event of downsizing during a market cycle is misconceived.  EECC \nin Houston has about 350 employees, many of whom are accountants, lawyers, \ncontract specialists, program managers,  all of whom have skill sets which \nare in demand in other Enron business units.  Therefore, any downsizing of \nEECC, if done over a reasonable period of time should be able to avoid a \nsignificant severance cost risk.\n\nNevertheless, as Enron changes to a less-asset dependent company, and because \nof the current value in monetizing assets, the need for change is necessary.  \nI think it is important to agree on a clear plan and brief our employees, all \nof whom are stressed by the uncertainty of where they're going.  This will \nhave a negative impact on the company's performance, unless addressed.\n\nMy recommendations for evolving EECC is as follows:\n\na. Sell NEPCO and phase out other non-Enron third-party lump sum work \n(already on-going).\n\nb. Define a \"slice\" of EECC in Houston as \"NEPCO-Houston,\" and package this \nwith the NEPCO sell.  A buyer might value the EECC-Houston expertise in \ncogeneration and gas-related services.\n\nc. Finish the Enron work now under contract, which will take from one to two \nyears.\n\nd. Continue to self-perform any new Enron work in the future which I see \ncentered in North America, Europe and possibly Brazil where assets may be \nrequired to enhance the Enron networks being developed for trading purposes.  \nI think it would be a mistake to allow the decentralized business units to \nattempt to manage outside EPC contractors without a residual Center of \nExcellence (EECC).\n\ne. Move EECC inside EES, allowing EES to take advantage of a continued income \nstream from EECC.  A subsequent step would be to merge the infrastructure \nbetween EES' Global Services and EECC.\n\nf. Slowly downsize the company as the current work evolves and the work load \npermits.\n\ng. Continue to develop engineering services for customers, without taking \nconstruction risks, but taking advantage of our reputation for due diligence \nand risk mitigation.  I think this effort could fit well inside EES as \nanother service provided by Enron.\n\nh. Continue EECC's initiative to develop an E-commerce revenue stream, \ncurrently being undertaken in coordination with Enron Networks, but relying \non EECC's intellectual capital, lessons learned and contacts in the \nindustry.  I think we have good potential for this opportunity, which is \nactively underway.\n\nIn summary, EECC's assets are the intellectual capital of its people and the \ncollective systems and procedures it has developed.  Both can continue to \nprovide value to Enron inside EES.  I've been discussing details with Lou and \nJoe, but I strongly recommend we agree on a clearly defined plan and allow me \nto communicate it to our employees.\n\n\nLI43200",

Included among those \nwas Secretary Summers who said:\n\n\"Nobody I know has the determination she has to get objectives met.\"\n\"Far more capacity to grasp the details than anyone I've seen.\"\n\n On Monday, I will seek Executive Committee approval to extend the offer to \nLinda.\n\n\n\n",

PAGER: 888-781-2151 \nNew Radio Ad Slams Corzine Dishonesty \nSurrounding Questionable Financial Dealings\n\nWashington, DC -- Calling the campaign of liberal New Jersey Democrat Senate \ncandidate Jon Corzine, \"a cynical and manipulative effort to deceive New \nJersey voters about Corzine's questionable and mysterious financial \ndealings,\" Mark Miller, Executive Director of the Republican Leadership \nCouncil (RLC) announced the release of a new radio ad that begins airing this \nmorning throughout New Jersey. \n\nThe text of the 60-second radio ad, entitled \"Dodge,\" is as follows: \n\nAnnouncer: \n\nMoney can buy multi-millionaire Jon Corzine a lot, but it can't buy New \nJersey's trust... he must earn it.? And that's a problem for Jon Corzine. \n? \nAccording to recent news reports, Jon Corzine is having trouble with the \ntruth. \n\nCorzine and his supporters were asked if Jon Corzine had contributed to their \norganizations prior to receiving their political endorsements.? The answer \nwas \"no\". \n\nNow, Corzine's own records indicate his foundation did give one of the groups \na contribution.? Corzine responded that the contribution came before he \nannounced his candidacy.? But Corzine's own records revealed that he made the \ncontribution after he announced his candidacy.? Corzine said the tax exempt \ncontribution was for an after school program.? But the group's leader said \nthat Corzine knew the contribution was for a political office. \n\nCall Jon Corzine at 973/643-0500.? Tell him trust is something money can't \nbuy.? Paid for by the Republican Leadership Council. \n\n?Said Miller: \"Jon Corzine has created his own campaign problems by \ncontinuing to shroud his financial past in secrecy.? Mr. Corzine's vast \nwealth has allowed him to buy a record number of slick political ads, but if \nhe thinks he can simply purchase the trust of New Jerseyans, he's in for a \nvery unpleasant surprise.\" \n\n# # # \nTo subscribe or unsubscribe send your name and e-mail address to \ninfo@rlcnet.org or visit www.rlcnet.org.\n\n\n",

Linda would head our Washington, D.C. \noffice, replacing Joe Hillings who will be retiring early next year.\n\n Linda has interviewed with Ken Lay, Tom White, Mike McConnell and Jeff \nShankman, who join me in this recommendation.\n\n Attached are biographical information on Linda and a National Journal \narticle identifying Linda among the \"Washington 100\".\n\n We have conducted extensive reference checks on Linda.  Included among those \nwas Secretary Summers who said:\n\n\"Nobody I know has the determination she has to get objectives met.\"\n\"Far more capacity to grasp the details than anyone I've seen.\"\n\n On Monday, I will seek Executive Committee approval to extend the offer to \nLinda.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Are we really a \ndark and Orwellian ship?\n\nThere has been a lot of emphasis placed on becoming more sensitive, as a \nsociety, to the issue of gun violence.\n\nEnron comes off demonic in this commercial, much like Nike comes off as \nsatanic in their chainsaw commercial which NBC pulled.\n\nPerhaps this is all a  publicity stunt, where we have CNBC refuse to run the \nad and then generate an exponential increase in the publicity we receive. \nThat would be clever. If not, I would ask you to reconsider the decency of \nthe ad, and to ask the Executive Committee how a group of decnet people could \ndesign such an ad.\n\nSincerely,\n\nClayton Vernon\n\n\n\n",

  "text": "Joe,\n\nHere's a possibility.  Let me know what you think.\n\nDear Clayton,\n\nThanks for your note about our new television ad.  Our goal with the ad \ncampaign is to increase Enron's familiarity and favorability with business \nand government opinion leaders.  We want to do that by communicating the \ninnovative culture at Enron that always asks the question, \"Why?\"  When we \nheard businesses blaming poor financial performance on their inability to \nmanage weather risks, we asked, \"Why?\"  We answered that with our weather \nderivatives product that helps companies protect revenues from unfavorable \nweather.  Now, many equity analysts and other investors are challenging \ncompanies that don't use weather derivatives as a risk management tool.\n\nIn order to get our message across in a cluttered advertising environment, we \nneed to create compelling images to get that message accross.  The use of a \ntraditional symbol (the old cork gun shooting gallery) applied in a \nnon-traditional way (shooting down conventional wisdom) gets the point across \nvery directly that traditional excuses don't \"stand up\" to today's markets.  \nI think it's a powerful, and humorous, symbolic message.\n\nI'm sorry if you're taking the reference to an old-fashioned game literally.  \nI can assure you that no ducks or CEOs were harmed in the making of the \ncommercial.  \n\nSincerely,\n\nJoe Sutton\n\n(Obviously, you can delete the smart-alecky last sentence.)",

  "text": "The Holocaust Museum Houston's Human Race event is scheduled for February 4, \n2001. Once again, Enron is the title sponsor of this fabulous event. We are \nplanning a media kick-off event to take place at the Holocaust Museum on \nNovember 20, 2000 at 10 a.m. The purpose of this event is to attract media \nattention and officially open registration for the race. If your schedule \nallows, we would like for you to speak at the kick-off again, as you did last \nyear.\n\nMayor Brown, HISD Superintendent Rod Paige and Ed Allday, event chair for the \nHuman Race, will also speak at the kick-off. The museum would like for each \nspeaker to spend approximately five minutes talking about the importance of \ndiversity in their respective environments. For example, the mayor will talk \nabout diversity in the city of Houston, Rod Paige will speak to diversity in \nschools, Ed will talk about how the event highlights diversity, and you would \nbe asked to talk about how Enron approaches diversity in the work-place.\n\nIf you are able to do this, Community Relations will draft your speaking \npoints. We will call Rosie to check on your availability.\n\nMany thanks,\n\nMissy Stevens",

The=20\nservice is explained in the executive summary attached, but in a nutshell=\n=20\nthey solve the need for reliable information support for schools by getting=\n=20\nthe server out of the schools and onto an Application Service Provider. The=\n=20\nresult is much better information (attendance, grading, assignments,=20\nmessages, etc.) but the schools only need a simple computer with a browser =\nto=20\naccess the service. If one computer breaks, they simply move to another=20\ncomputer and access the service. This is the same concept as Questia, but=\n=20\nthey can get by with much older computer technology, which is a big plus fo=\nr=20\nschools. Also, parents can access essentially real time information about=\n=20\ntheir child=01,s grades and attendance, and can easily communicate with the=\n=20\nteacher through the messaging.\n\n?\n\nWhen I met with them in April, I liked the idea but was consumed with=20\nQuestia. Since then, they have launched a beta test and then rolled out the=\n=20\nproduction version of the service in the DeSoto ISD. They trained over 200=\n=20\nteachers and have proven the simplicity and effectiveness of their system.=\n=20\nLamar Consolidated ISD has requested that they rollout the service in three=\n=20\ntest schools this fall.? They also just hired a new CEO, Roland Rodriquez, =\nto=20\nlead the company, with the founder continuing to be involved.\n\n?\n\nThey are trying to raise $3 million. John Chaney and I met with them Tuesda=\ny=20\nmorning and decided after the meeting that we were both interested in putti=\nng=20\naround half a million in the company, and that we needed to get three or fo=\nur=20\nothers to put in about the same amount.? We are both willing to go on the=\n=20\nboard, with one or two other new outside directors.\n\n?\n\nKen, this is not in the same ballpark as Questia, but it is a very good ide=\na=20\nand I believe they can pull it off.

  "text": "     RPI TO INITIATE PHASE II CLINICAL TRIALS ON ANTI-HEPATITIS C DRUG\n\nBOULDER,  Colorado  -  September  28,  2000: Ribozyme Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n(RPI)  (NASDAQ:RZYM)  today announced that it has repurchased its rights to\nHeptazyme?  from  Eli Lilly and Company and will initiate Phase II clinical\ntrials  as  soon  as  possible  for  the Anti-Hepatitis C ribozyme to study\ndose-ranging  and  biological  markers  of  the  drug's efficacy in chronic\nHepatitis C patients.\n\nEarlier  this month, RPI and Eli Lilly and Company completed a 28 day study\nof Heptazyme (LY466700) following daily subcutaneous injections that showed\nsuccessful  safety,  tolerability  and pharmacokinetics.  The next phase of\nclinical trials will examine the safety and efficacy of Heptazyme alone, at\nhigher  doses  than  used  in  previous  studies,  and  in combination with\ninterferon,  a  current  treatment  for  patients  with  Hepatitis C  virus\ninfection.\n\nLilly has directed the clinical trials for the Anti-Hepatitis C ribozyme to\ndate   under   a   licensing   agreement  between  the  parties.   Ribozyme\nPharmaceuticals,  Inc.  has now renegotiated the global rights to Heptazyme\nand  will  direct  all  subsequent  clinical trials.  The Phase II trial is\nexpected to begin in the first quarter of 2001.\n\n\"We  are  pleased  to  be  able  to repurchase Heptazyme rights and to have\nresources  to  develop  it aggressively,\" said Ralph E. Christoffersen, CEO\nand  President  of RPI.  \"We are committed to address the need for improved\ntherapies  for  HCV,  and  plan  to  move forward as quickly as feasible in\nHeptazyme's development.\"\n\nRibozymes   are  the  product  of  Nobel  Prize  winning  science  and  are\nsynthetically engineered to act as \"molecular scissors\" capable of cleaving\ntarget RNA in a highly specific manner.\n\nRPI (www.rpi.com), located in Boulder, Colorado, is the acknowledged leader\nin ribozyme therapeutic development.  RPI has recently announced a ribozyme\ncommercial  development  program  to develop a ribozyme therapeutic against\nHepatitis  B.  RPI is partnered with Chiron Corporation for the development\nand  commercialization  of ANGIOZYME?, an anti-angiogenic ribozyme designed\nto  inhibit  the  growth  of new blood supplies to tumors and prevent tumor\ngrowth  and  metastasis.   ANGIOZYME  is  in  Phase I/II clinical trials in\ncancer  patients  at  the  Cleveland Clinic.  RPI is also partnered with an\naffiliate  of Elan Corporation plc for development and commercialization of\nHERZYME?, an anti-HER-2 ribozyme for treatment of breast and other cancers,\nthrough RPI's subsidiary Medizyme Pharmaceuticals Ltd.\n\nRPI  will  have  a Live Webcast regarding this information today at 3:00 pm\nMDT.  This webcast can be accessed through the RPI website (www.rpi.com) in\nthe Investor Relations section.\n\n\nThis  press  release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks\nand  uncertainties,  and  actual  events  or results may differ materially.\nThese   risk   factors   include   actions   by  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug\nAdministration,   technological  advances,  ability  to  obtain  rights  to\ntechnology, ability to obtain and enforce patents, ability to commercialize\nand  manufacture  products  and  general  economic  conditions.

  "text": "Ken and Mark,\n\nRichard Lewis mentioned to me that you had recently read an article about \nRegenesys, the large-scale battery technology being developed in the UK, and \nwanted to know more about Enron's potential interest in this technology.  I \nam a Manager in our UK Origination and have tracked the progress of Regenesys \nsince it first came on the scene over one year ago.  We have watched it with \ninterest given the historical peak/off-peak spread in this country's power \nmarket.  Bruce Stram and I have also co-ordinated our efforts on the \npreliminary analysis.\n\nBelow is a brief summary of Regenesys, our initial views on the technology \nand our response going forward.\n\nTechnology Summary\nlarge-scale battery system using two oppositely-charged electrolytes that are \nseparated by an ion exchange membrane\ncurrent generating plant capacity up to 14.75 MW per unit (or 120 MWh per day)\nresponse time within 20 milliseconds\nit can release full power within a few seconds thereby yielding brief \ncapacity of up to 500 MW\n$1500 / kW capital costs initially which are expected to decrease to approx. \n$750 / kW \n18 month build time for facility which requires a site of just under 1 \nhectare (50 m x 60 m)\n\n\nLatest Developments\nInnogy announced last month that it will proceed with it's first Regenesys \nplant at Aberthaw Power Station in the UK\nTennessee Valley Authority has just signed some form of agreement with Innogy \non the Regenesys technology but there are no firm decisions to build a unit \nthere yet\n\nOur Cynical Point of View\nInnogy have got to go a long way before they can make this technology \ncommercially successful\nOur initial analysis shows that based on the peak/off-peak spreads they need \nto achieve capital costs less than $600 / kW to be successful - we have not \nseen evidence that this can be achieved\nInnogy have been hyping up the technology in the past month to support the \nforthcoming spilt of National Power and to prepare for a potential floatation\nThere has been a flurry of press releases and news articles recently yet the \nspecifications of the technology (including capital cost) have not improved \nsince we first looked at this in July 1999\nInnogy touts this as a revolution in energy storage for peak/off-peak \narbitrage, however, commercially it does not compare to having large-scale \ndiesel standby generation\n\nOn the Brighter Side\nThe real potential for this technology could be in supporting grid systems \nIt has good black start and frequency response capabilities\n\nWay Forward\nWe are evaluating the commercial attraction of the black start and frequency \nresponse characteristics with respect to our interests in the UK\nI will continue to liaise with Bruce Stram in evaluating any further \npotential in the US\n\nPlease let me know if you would like any further details on the above.\n\nRegards,\n\nChris",

After we\nspoke, I conferred with John Watson who, like me, believed that we were\ngoing to use terms of the Enron Field financing for the Arena, with a few\nminor changes that we had discussed.  The term sheet that we originally\nprovided you during the summer reflected that arrangement.  We have\ndiscussed that term sheet with the partners, believing it to be the deal,\nand they have approved the garage loan on those terms.\n\nJohn and I believe that the comments on the term sheet that you, James\nHernandez and Mike Bartolotta have provided us recently constitute a\nsignificant departure from the Enron Field deal.  Although we understand the\narguments each of you have made in favor of such comments, these comments\nnonetheless will need to be evaluated by a business representative from the\npartnership and approved by the partnership.  I recommend that we schedule a\nmeeting next week so that we can discuss these issues and try to resolve\nthem.\n\nFinally, John was disappointed to hear that the HCHSA will be unwilling to\nprepay the $1.4 million amount needed by the referendum.  Because we\nunderstand that the referendum campaign is in dire need of funding, we hope\nthat you might reconsider your decision not to prepay the $1.4 million until\nafter we have finalized the term sheet.\n\nI will be unavailable for a great deal of the day today, but I will have\ntime to meet next week.  Please let me know when we might be able to get\ntogether to discuss the term sheet.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael S. Telle",

For instance, former Senator Bradley, and his wife, may be\nexpected to draw $7,900,000, with Mrs.. Bradley drawing $275,000 during\nthe last year of her life. This is calculated on an average life span\nfor each. This would be well and good, except that they paid nothing in\non any kind of retirement, and neither does any other Senator or\nCongressman.\n\nThis fine\nretirement comes right out of the General Fund: our tax money. While we\nwho pay for it all, draw an average of $1000/month from Social Security.\nImagine for a moment that you could structure a retirement plan so\ndesirable that people would have extra deducted so that they could\nincrease their own personal retirement income. A retirement plan that\nworks so well, that  Railroad employees, Postal Workers, and others who\naren't in it, would clamor to get in. That is how good Social Security\ncould be, if only one small change were made. That change is to jerk the\nGolden Fleece retirement out from under the Senators and Congressmen,\nand put them in Social Security with the rest of us. Then watch how fast\nthey fix it. If enough people receive this, maybe one or some of them\nalong the way,  might be able to help.\n\nHow many can YOU send it to ??\n\nWilliam R.

  "text": "Dear Ken,\n\nI'd like to thank you for your continued participation in this project.\n\nI thought it would make sense to quickly recap where we are following last\nweek's meeting.\n\n1. We will redraft the report to reflect several trains of thought.  We\nwill, for example, express a greater appreciation for the fact that there\nare major problems with the current financial reporting framework, a big gap\nbetween GAAP and the real world in which investors must make their\njudgements.  We will devote much more attention to the issue of intangibles,\nincluding the need for a common language to describe them.  We will\nelaborate on the issue of the environment for disclosure, suggesting that we\nneed a way of thinking about the concept of safe harbor, one which is based\non the notion that the way to protect investors amid so much uncertainty is\nto make it easier for companies to provide forward looking information,\nknowing that no one can be fully confident of any projections these days.\nWe will be much bolder in recommending several groups - the SEC, FASB,\ninstitutional investors - take a much greater interest in the deficiencies\nof the reporting model and ask the questions, commission the studies, etc.\n\nAll of this will still be within the framework of the spirit of the last\ndraft - that is, we're against more regulation at this time, against\nprescriptive one-size-fits-all mandates, etc.  And we believe that the\nmarket is forcing disclosure already - but maybe not quickly or\ncomprehensively enough.\n\n2. Some of the panel members will have supplementary views.  Can you\nbegin to put pen to paper now?  Here is my speculation as to who may want to\nsay what:\n\n* Len Baker and Rob Glaser may wish to write something on the recent\n\"Fair Disclosure\" decision.  I sense that Dennis Powell might wish to join.\nLen, can you take the lead?  I'd suggest no more than one page, preferably\nhalf a page.\n\n* John Neff may wish to express skepticism about the value of\ndeveloping a new language for intangibles.\n\n* John Doerr and Len Baker may wish to say something about accounting\nfor pooling or stock options.  Again, please keep it very short.  John, can\nyou take the lead?\n\nIf anyone else is thinking about a supplementary view, please let me know.\nWe would appreciate these submissions by October 15.\n\n3. Future Schedule.  We agreed to \"get it right\" and not to stop until\nwe do.   The next steps, it seems to me are:\n\n* Get you a new draft\n* Get your views either in a meeting or conference call to be\nscheduled\n* See where we are then\n\nHowever, I'd like to suggest that we aim to finish this report by December\n15, 2000 if at all possible.\n\nPlease let me know if I've missed anything or if you have additional ideas.\n\nBest regards,\nJeff\n\n",

In light of\nthe complexity of the reporting rules and the potential for severe\npenalties for noncompliance, please contact me in advance of any\ntransaction.  As a reminder, the SEC rules cover all transactions,\nincluding:\n\n-   purchases\n-   sales\n-   gifts\n-   trust or partnership transactions\n-   transactions in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan\n-   exchange fund transactions\n\nWe request advance notification of Lilly stock transactions for two\nreasons:\n\n   There are certain times when you should not engage in market\n   transactions in Lilly stock.  Routinely, these \"black-outs\" occur around\n   the end of each quarter through the time quarterly/annual earnings are\n   announced.  In addition, occasionally, we are aware of \"inside\n   information\" that may be considered material and we therefore advise our\n   reporting persons to avoid open market transactions in Lilly stock.\n   While you may not know of the event, the knowledge may be imputed to\n   you.  Advance communication allows you to avoid situations that may have\n   legal consequences, or if not, at least may cause embarassment.\n\n2.   We prepare for you the required reports of the transaction to the SEC.\n\nIf you had any Lilly stock transactions in September, please advise me as\nsoon as possible.  We will prepare the required reports for your signature\nand file them with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\").  The\nreports must be received by the SEC and the NYSE no later than the 10th day\nof the month following the month in which the transaction occurs.  If I am\nnot available, please contact Jim Lootens (317-276-5835) regarding any\nproposed transaction.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding these matters, please do not hesitate\nto call me.

We are ready\nto obtain our first round of financing.  We would like\nto have 5 co-branding partners who would receive equity positions in\nour company.  We would incorporate their logo throughout our site and\ninclude their PR materials with each order shipped.  Target partners\nwould include the utility and energy companies.  Since your\ncompany is active in this market, you may know of someone who can assist\nus.\n\nWe see utility/energy companies as a compatable fit because of their\ninterest in projecting a positive wildlife/environmental image.\n\nAbout our company:\n\nWildlifeCollectibles.Com is a specialty catalog company featuring\nwildlife merchandise.  We have the world's largest selection of wildlife\nmerchandise.  Currently in the wildlife merchandise niche\nthere are no entities offering broad merchandise selections for each\nanimal specie.  We are filling this void by operating 22 \"sub-niche\"\nstores under the WildlifeCollectibles.Com brand.  These 22 storefronts\nwill represent 105 wildlife species.  Seven of these storefronts are\noperational and the backend inventory systems are complete for the other\n15.  We are in the process of loading them on the Internet.\n\nOne major component not yet installed on our site is our \"Facts About\nthe Specie\" page.  We will have reference information available for\nevery wildlife specie listed on our site.  At present,\nthere is no central repository of reference material available for most\nspecies.  Britanica.com has reference information available for only 11\nspecies.  This will attract school age children with their parents\ntagging along.\n\nWe are looking for a total of 5 million dollars.  In order to assist\ncompanies in purchasing an equity position/co-branded arrangement with\nus, we are willing to finance their investment.  We will take $25,000.00\na month for 40 months from 5 corporate partners.  This will allow them\nto budget the expense through Public Relations or Marketing.\n\nI hope I have given you enough information to understand what\nwe would like to do, so you can either assist us or point us in the\nright direction.  We would pay a commission and provide a small equity\nstake in our company to the individual who signs on the utility/energy\ncompanies for us.\n\nSincerely,\nRudy Socha\nPresident\nWildlifeCollectibles.Com\nP.O.

The contract is a 3-year \nVBN deal covering certain i2 locations in the U.S., Europe, Asia, and India.  \nThe TCV of the deal is $14.8 million.\n\nThis is one of the first major external VBN deals for Enron and has been \ninstrumental in shaping the VBN offering.  It also brings an anchor network \nclient to our Tokyo and India sites.  The interactions with i2 on this \nagreement have also contributed to our understanding of which BOS features \nare most desired by customers.\n\nThe i2 deal is the result of a lot of hard work and persistence by a number \nof folks throughout EBS and other Enron groups.  Just about everyone in EBS' \nTechnology Channels Group contributed to the i2/Enron relationship that \nculminated in the network deal.  Particular thanks to Mike Haney who led the \nteam through multiple iterations of the deal structure.  Special thanks to \nDavid Berberian, Erin Wesling, and Brad Harris who spent lots of time on the \ncontract and the network design work with i2.  Thanks also to LaRence \nSnowden, Tony Gilmore, and Beaven Fernandez of TDS, Steve McCarrel of Legal, \nWayne Gardner of Tax, and Laura Leibman of Regulatory who helped throughout \nthe course of the deal structuring and to  Everett Plante, Larry Ciscon, and \nKenny Burroughs and their teams who provided input on BOS and network \ntopics.  In addition, thanks to the Enron India team who supported the deal \nthroughout the design and negotiation process.\n\ni2 has remarked often on the professionalism and collaborative spirit of the \nEnron team throughout this process.  Enron is now i2's preferred network \nprovider, and we are poised to provide the rest of i2's data network \nworldwide as soon as the design specifications are completed by i2.  Thanks \nagain to the entire team on your success.  Best regards.\n\n-- Rex\n",

What a fantastic way to conduct a meeting. I \nwas able to listen while I worked, stopping only when a particular subject \naroused my attention. And being able to see the slide presentation at the \nsame time was so much better than  trying to read that little type from a \nlong distance over a sea of heads that keep bobbing. \n\nThe only problem I experienced was a cutting out of the audio signal. Once a \nsituation like this is resolved I believe Enron may have found the ideal \nsolution to communicate to all their employees in a less costly and time \nconsuming method than the standard meeting. \n\nThanks for taking my comments.\n\nRobert S.

  "text": "Ken\n\nI mentioned in a voicemail today that you should be receiving a phone call \nfrom James (Jimbo) Moffet (504) 582-4000.  He is Chairman of Freeport McMahon \nin New Orleans.  James had mentioned to Thomas Boettcher & Michael Hutchinson \nin our Metals group that he knew you and wanted to make sure you were \nsupportive of our discussions with them.  Here is the background on a \npossible acquisition that we have brought up with them:\n\n            Enron Metals is very interested in pursuing further discussions \nwith Atlantic Copper on the acquisition of their smelter in Spain.  Estimated \ncapital would be US$350 Million.  Acquiring this asset gives us the \nopportunity to build copper and copper concentrate positions and more \neffectively managing our positions in the market place. We would finance this \noff balance sheet.\n\n Mr. James Targetta, head of Atlantic Copper (copper smelter and refinery in \nSpain and fully owned by Freeport McMoran) had a conversation with James \nMoffet, Chairman of Freeport McMoran last Friday informing him about our \npreliminary conversations.   Moffet advised Targetta not to proceed further \nuntil he speaks to you since he has known you for 25 years.  \n\n In addition, Targetta mentioned the possibility for Enron purchasing all the \ncopper mining activities of  Freeport McMoran which would leave them as an \noil and exploration company.\n\nWe think there are some great possibilities here.    \n\nIf you have not heard from him in the next few days, I would really \nappreciate you giving Moffet a call.   I would be more than happy to get a \nmore extensive briefing for you if you think you need it.   I look forward to \ndiscussing this further with you.\n\nJohn",

It was \nthis:\n\nThe Enron sponsored Houston mini-cart Grand Prix entry placed second and \nreceived free air time of \"Enron\" on the news. With NASCAR being as popular \nas it is today, itself a multi-billion dollar industry, why hasn't Enron \nsponsored a racing team to compete against the other Fortune 500 sponsors? \nEnron is supporting stadiums, but why not a competition based on fuel, \nenergy, and the most powerful being the victor?\n\nNow with cigarettes and alcohol banned from advertising, companies such as \nAOL, Compaq, Southern Company, and Infoseek are on the tracks. Each race \nwould provide more airtime of the Enron logo and further placement of \"The \nNew Power Company\" in the retail consumer/viewer's venue. It would also give \nme someone to \"root\" for.\n\nKelly Merritt\nAsset Mgr. - CALME/ENA",

Let me\nfill you in with some more background information about us.\nI am the founder of DDI (the second largest wireline and wireless private\ntelecom operator in Japan). Today's DDI market capitalization is around $20\nbillion. I left DDI at the end of 1995 and became a professor and Keio\nUniversity Business School for 4 years. I have also been an active member in\nthe government telecom deregulation committee. I left Keio University last\nyear and founded eAccess in November 1999. With less than one year in\noperation, eAccess has already established a strong presence in the Japanese\ntelecom market. We have three phases in our long-term business plan, (1)\nbroadband access network; (2) CSP and ASP streaming related business; (3) IP\nmetropolitan backbone infrastructure business. As we are currently looking\nfor the best global strategic partner to achieve the goal together, we\nbelieve that Enron could become a strong potential partner in Japan.\n\nIf you need any more information about eAccess, please do not hesitate to\ncall or email me.\nI am looking forward to seeing you on October 13.\n\nRegards\n\nDr. Sachio Semmoto\n\nPS : Please advise me email addresses of Messrs. Lay, Skilling and Rice.\n\n\n\n",

Bush Debate Win/Al Gore's Lies\n\nI hope you got a chance to see the debate last night.  George W. Bush did a\nvery good job articulating his message and debating Al Gore.\n\nI am sure it will come as no surprise to you that Al Gore could not go the\nentire debate without telling a lie.  In fact, two lies have been exposed so\nfar.\n\nThe first one was Gore's claim that he visited Texas with FEMA Director,\nJames Lee Witt, after the bad Texas floods and tornadoes.  As it turns out,\nthat was a lie.  Al Gore on the morning news shows today claimed that he\nthought he had, but it must have been another state.  Go figure.\n\nThe next lie exposed is as follows:\n\nNews radio 970 WFLA interviewed the principal of Sarasota High this morning.\nHe said that the girl that Gore was talking about had no desk for exactly\none day.  It was the first day of class and they were still making\nadjustments to the kids class schedule and that particular classroom was\nbeing refurbished.  The teacher only had to call the office and get her a\ndesk because they have plenty of desks there.  Apparently there is a picture\nthat was sent to Gore of her standing in class or something like that\nbecause the Principal mentions that in the picture of her there is $100,000\nof new equipment behind her.\n\nPlease pass this along to your friends and family and any undecided voters.\nThe more people who realize that Al Gore is a pathological liar, the better\nGeorge W. Bush will do.\n\nPlease check out the two links and cast your vote for George W. Bush as the\nwinner in last night's debate:  http://news.excite.com/news/poll/ or\nhttp://www.cnn.com/\n\nLast but not least....Have you done everything you can do to elect George W.\nBush?  Have you made a small contribution to Victory 2000?  Have you\nparticipated in a literature drop for the GOP Ticket or made phone calls on\nits behalf?  If not, please let me know.\n\nThanks for your support.\n\nPaid for by Victory 2000\n\n***To unsubscribe from these Victory 2000 Updates, please simply respond to\nthis email with \"unsubscribe\" typed into the subject line and your name will\nbe removed.***",

  "text": "Ken, we met a while back--'94 or so--when I was editor of Fortune. It's in\nmy current incarnation, though, as Editorial Director for the Harvard\nBusiness School Publishing Co. and head of its publishing division--we\npublish the Harvard Business Review, HBS Press books (including Leading the\nRevolution from your friend and skiing companion Gary Hamel), and the best\nselling management newsletter in the country, among other things--that I\nwanted to put a proposition before you to see if we might interest you in\nwhat I think may be an important idea-development and publishing\nopportunity.\nHBSPC has become quite interested in the subject of corporate venturing, of\nhow companies can invest in innovation and new organizational forms (but you\nknow all about that) in a transformative way, so much so that we're planning\nto put on a couple of conferences on the subject next year. (The purpose of\nour conferences, in general, is to push ideas ahead and advance the thinking\non a particular topic.) They will be smallish, half-day affairs--we're\nlooking at an audience of perhaps 75 senior executives at each--one in New\nYork in January, the second in San Francisco, probably the first week in\nFebruary. As with the authors of the books and HBR articles that we publish,\nwe're committed to having only top-flight experts on the program, mostly on\npanels. (For instance, we're talking with the Harvard Business School\nprofessors who teach the executive education course on corporate venturing\nabout their serving on and putting together one of the panels.) And we, of\ncourse, thought of you and Enron--who knows more about the subject? As we've\ndesigned the conferences, we've concluded that a great way to begin the\nprogram would be to have a sort of a keynote from a CEO grounded in the\nreal-world experience of making this happen. But we don't want to impose on\nyour time, or that of your staff, to put together a speech. Our thought was\nto have the session be more like \"A conversation with...\", wherein an\ninterlocutor (probably me, but maybe assisted by a couple of others) would\nput questions to you, and draw you out on the points you thought important.\nWe could confer on the questions beforehand as much or little as you'd like.\nKen Chenault of American Express has agreed to play this role at the New\nYork conference. We'd wondered if there were any possibility of interesting\nyou in it for the San Francisco conference? Enron has the best record of any\ncompany on this front, and my secret hope is that the conversation might\nserve as the basis of an article (or even the first step toward a book?)\nthat HBSP might eventually publish. We know, too, that you have endless\ndemands on your time, and if it would help you to think more favorably of\nusing it in this way, we'd be happy to provide an honararium for the charity\nor charities of your choice.\nI'm sure you're besieged with emails on your return from vacation,  but if\nyou have a moment to marinate on this, we'd welcome the chance to answer any\nquestions you might have about the event. I have two offices and two phone\nnumbers (New York, Monday, Tuesday, and most Fridays, at 212-872-9281,\nBoston the rest of the week at 617-783-7535) but the most efficient way for\nyour office to schedule a conversation might be to have them be in touch\nwith Maria Carnevale here in New York at 212-872-9285) or just shoot me back\nan email.\nThanks for taking the time for this overlong email. Our eyes are beginning\nto open here to the landscape shaking, transformative possibilities of\ncorporate venturing, as became clear to you long ago. We'd be grateful for\nthe opportunity to help you share some of your wisdom with others.\nAll the best,\nWalter Kiechel\n",

But=\n=20\nnow Enron is providing me with a computer, and I can't thank you enough for=\n=20\nthis opportunity!   I have been with Enron for 18 years and have seen it=20\nchange, evolve, improve and grow!   And throughout those years I have alway=\ns=20\nbeen proud to be a part of this great company and do appreciate how well yo=\nu=20\nhave taken care of us... and continue to take care of us...the employees!  =\n=20\nEnron is truly a great place to work!\n\nThank you,\nCindy Stark\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Cindy Stark/Corp/Enron on 10/05/2000=20\n09:48 AM ---------------------------\n Office of the Chairman\nFrom: Office of the Chairman on 10/05/2000 07:55 AM\nTo: ClickatHome mailout\ncc: =20\nSubject: A Computer and Internet Connection for You and Your Family\n\nAs you know, technology is critical to Enron; it drives our success and wil=\nl=20\ncontinue to do so in the future. Technology has helped Enron create new=20\nbusinesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is=20\nresponsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com.  You=\n=01,ve=20\nseen what technology can do at work.  Now we want you and your family to=20\nrealize its benefits at home.\n\nWith that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=\nhe=20\nClickAtHome\nprogram, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20\ntechnology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=\n=20\nclick of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of=\n=20\nInternet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20\n\nWe have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=\n=20\nthe computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=\n=20\ncase you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=\n=20\ncomputer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20\nClickAtHome includes the following:\n\n? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=\n=20\ndisk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=\n=20\nsoftware. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=\n=20\nconnection, including broadband, where commercially available.\n? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=\n=20\nand regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=\n=20\nhowever, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=\n,=20\nEnron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20\naccounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20\nemployed at the time of implementation. =20\n? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=\n=20\nthe equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=\nry=20\nof equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.\n\nDetails about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of=\n=20\nyour initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on=\n=20\nhttp://clickathome.enron.com.  We will schedule an eSpeak session in the ne=\nar=20\nfuture where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can=20\nsubmit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@enron.com.=20\n\nWe are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your=20\nfamily.  We believe this program takes communication at Enron to a new leve=\nl=20\nby creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in=\n=20\nthe broadband Internet revolution. It is just another reason why we believe=\n=20\nEnron is a great place to work.\n",
